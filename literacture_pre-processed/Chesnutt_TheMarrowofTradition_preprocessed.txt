 stay here beside her major i shall not he needed for an hour yet meanwhile ill go downstairs and snatch a bit of sleep or talk to old jane

the night was hot and sultry though the windows of the chamber were wide open and the muslin curtains looped back not a breath of air was stirring only the shrill chirp of the cicada and the muffled croaking of the frogs in some distant marsh broke the night silence the heavy scent of magnolias overpowering even the strong smell of drugs in the sickroom suggested death and funeral wreaths sorrow and tears the long home the last sleep the major shivered with apprehension as the slender hand which he held in his own contracted nervously and in a spasm of pain clutched his fingers with a viselike grip

major carteret though dressed in brown linen had thrown off his coat for greater comfort the stifling heat in spite of the palmleaf fan which he plied mechanically was scarcely less oppressive than his own thoughts long ago while yet a mere boy in years he had come back from appomattox to find his family one of the oldest and proudest in the state hopelessly impoverished by the war â even their ancestral home swallowed up in the common ruin his elder brother had sacrificed his life on the bloody altar of the lost cause and his father broken and chagrined died not many years later leaving the major the last of his line he had tried in various pursuits to gain a foothold in the new life but with indifferent success until he won the hand of olivia merkell whom he had seen grow from a small girl to glorious womanhood with her money he had founded the morning chronicle which he had made the leading organ of his party and the most influential paper in the state the fine old house in which they lived was hers in this very room she had first drawn the breath of life it had been their nuptial chamber and here too within a few hours she might die for it seemed impossible that one could long endure such frightful agony and live

one cloud alone had marred the otherwise perfect serenity of their happiness olivia was childless to have children to perpetuate the name of which he was so proud to write it still higher on the roll of honor had been his dearest hope his disappointment had been proportionately keen a few months ago this dead hope had revived and altered the whole aspect of their lives but as time went on his wifes age had begun to tell upon her until even dr price the most cheerful and optimistic of physicians had warned him while hoping for the best to be prepared for the worst to add to the danger mrs carteret had only this day suffered from a nervous shock which it was feared had hastened by several weeks the expected event

dr price went downstairs to the library where a dim light was burning an old black woman dressed in a gingham frock with a red bandana handkerchief coiled around her head by way of turban was seated by an open window she rose and curtsied as the doctor entered and dropped into a willow rockingchair near her own

 how did this happen jane   he asked in a subdued voice adding with assumed severity  you ought to have taken better care of your mistress

and what became of julia asked dr price such relations the doctor knew very well had been all too common in the old slavery days and not a few of them had been projected into the new era sins like snakes die hard the habits and customs of a people were not to be changed in a day nor by the stroke of a pen as family physician and father confessor by brevet dr price had looked upon more than one hidden skeleton  and no one in town had had better opportunities than old jane for learning the undercurrents in the lives of the old families

major carteret from the head of the stairs called the doctor anxiously

 you had better come along up now jane said the doctor

for two long hours they fought back the grim spectre that stood by the bedside the child was bom at dawn both mother and child the doctor said would live

 bless its ittle heat  exclaimed mammy jane as she held up the tiny mite which bore as much resemblance to mature humanity as might be expected of an infant which had for only a few minutes drawn the breath of life  bless its ittle heat its de vey spit an image er its pappy 

the doctor smiled the major laughed aloud janes unconscious witticism or conscious flattery whichever it might be was a welcome diversion from the tense strain of the last few hours

be that as it may said dr price cheerfully  and ill not dispute it the child is a very fine boy â a very fine boy indeed  take care of it major he added with a touch of solemnity  for your wife can never bear another

with the childs first cry a refreshing breeze from the distant ocean cooled the hot air of the chamber the heavy odor of the magnolias with its mortuary suggestiveness gave place to the scent of rose and lilac and honeysuckle the birds in the garden were singing lustily

all these sweet and pleasant things found an echo in the majors heart he stood by the window and looking toward the rising sun breathed a silent prayer of thanksgiving all nature seemed to rejoice in sympathy with his happiness at the fruition of this longdeferred hope and to predict for this wonderful child a bright and glorious future

old mammy jane however was not entirely at ease concerning the child she had discovered under its left ear a small mole which led her to fear that the child was born for bad luck had the baby been black or yellow or poorwhite jane would unhesitatingly have named as his ultimate fate a not uncommon form of taking off usually resultant upon the infraction of certain laws or in these swift modern days upon too violent a departure from established social customs it was manifestly impossible that a child of such high quality as the grandson of her old mistress should die by judicial strangulation but nevertheless the warning was a serious thing and not to be lightly disregarded

not wishing to be considered as a prophet of evil omen jane kept her own counsel in regard to this significant discovery but later after the child was several days old she filled a small vial with water in which the infant had been washed and took it to a certain wise old black woman who lived on the farther edge of the town and was well known to be versed in witchcraft and conjuration the conjure woman added to the contents of the bottle a bit of calamus root and one of the cervical vertebrae from the skeleton of a black cat with several other mysterious ingredients the nature of which she did not disclose following instructions given her aunt jane buried the bottle in carterets back yard one night during the full moon as a goodluck charm to ward off evil from the little grandson of her dear mistress so long since dead and gone to heaven

they named the carteret baby theodore felix theodore was a family name and had been borne by the eldest son for several generations the major himself being a second son having thus given the child two beautiful names replete with religious and sentimental significance they called him â  dodie

the baby was christened some six weeks after its birth by which time mrs carteret was able to be out old mammy jane who had been brought up in the church but who like some better informed people in all ages found religion not inconsistent with a strong vein of superstition felt her fears for the babys future much relieved when the rector had made the sign of the cross and sprinkled little dodie with the water from the carved marble font which had come from england in the reign of king charles the martyr as the illfated son of james i was known to st andrews upon this special occasion mammy jane had been provided with a seat downstairs among the white people to her own intense satisfaction and to the secret envy of a small colored attendance in the gallery to whom she was ostentatiously pointed out by her grandson jerry porter at the morning chronicle office who sat among them in the front row

on the following monday evening the major gave a christening party in honor of this important event

owing to mrs carterets still delicate health only a small number of intimate friends and family connections were invited to attend these were the rector of st andrews  old mrs polly ochiltree the godmother  old mr delamere a distant relative and also one of the sponsors  and his grandson tom delamere the major had also invited lee ellis his young city editor for whom he had a great liking apart from his business value and who was a frequent visitor at the house these with the family itself which consisted of the major his wife and his halfsister clara pemberton a young woman of about eighteen made up the eight persons for whom covers were laid

ellis was the first to arrive a tall looselimbed young man with a slightly freckled face hair verging on auburn a firm chin and honest gray eyes he had come half an hour early and was left alone for a few minutes in the parlor a spacious highceilinged room with large windows and fitted up in excellent taste with stately reminiscences of a past generation the walls were hung with figured paper the ceiling was whitewashed and decorated in the middle with a plaster centrepiece from which hung a massive chandelier sparkling with prismatic rays from a hundred crystal pendants there was a handsome mantel set with terracotta tiles on which fauns and satyrs nymphs and dryads disported themselves in idyllic abandon the furniture was old and in keeping with the room

at seven oclock a carriage drove up from which alighted an elderly gentleman with white hair and mustache and bowed somewhat with years short of breath and painfully weak in the legs he was assisted from the carriage by a colored man apparently about forty years old to whom short sidewhiskers and spectacles imparted an air of sobriety this attendant gave his arm respectfully to the old gentleman who leaned upon it heavily but with as little appearance of dependence as possible the servant assuming a similar unconsciousness of the weight resting upon his arm assisted the old gentleman carefully up the steps

im all right now sandy whispered the gentleman as soon as his feet were planted firmly on the piazza  you may come back for me at nine oclock

having taken his hand from his servants arm he advanced to meet a lady who stood in the door awaiting him a tall elderly woman gaunt and angular of frame with a mottled face and high cheekbones partially covered by bands of hair entirely too black and abundant for a person of her age if one might judge from the lines of her mouth which are rarely deceptive in such matters

 perhaps youd better not send your man away mr delamere observed the lady in a high shrill voice which grated upon the old gentlemans ears he was slightly hard of hearing but like most deaf people resented being screamed at  you might need him before nine oclock one never knows what may happen after one has had the second stroke and moreover our butler has fallen down the back steps â negroes are so careless  â and sprained his ankle so that he cant stand id like to have sandy stay and wait on the table in peters place if you dont mind

 i thank you mrs ochiltree for your solicitude replied mr delamere with a shade of annoyance in his voice  but my health is very good just at present and i do not anticipate any catastrophe which will require my servants presence before i am ready to go home but i have no doubt madam he continued with a courteous inclination  that sandy will be pleased to serve you if you desire it to the best of his poor knowledge

 i shill be honored maam assented sandy with a bow even deeper than his masters only im feared i aint rightly dressed fer ter wait on table i wuz only goin ter prarmeetin an so i did n put on my bes clos ef mis ochiltree ain gwine ter need me fer de nex fifteen minutes i kin ride back home in de caige an dress mysef suitable fer de occasion suh

 if you think youll wait on the table any better said mrs ochiltree  you may go along and change your clothes  but hurry back for it is seven now and dinner will soon be served

sandy retired with a bow while descending the steps to the carriage which had waited for him he came face to face with a young man just entering the house

am i in time for dinner sandy asked the newcomer

 yas mistuh tom youre in plenty er time dinner wont be ready till i git back which won be fer fifteen minutes er so yit

throwing away the cigarette which he held between his fingers the young man crossed the piazza with a light step and after a preliminary knock for an answer to which he did not wait entered the house with the air of one thoroughly at home the lights in the parlor had been lit and ellis who sat talking to major carteret when the newcomer entered covered him with a jealous glance

slender and of medium height with a small head of almost perfect contour a symmetrical face dark almost to swarthiness black eyes which moved somewhat restlessly curly hair of raven tint a slight mustache small hands and feet and fashionable attire tom delamere the grandson of the old gentleman who had already arrived was easily the handsomest young man in wellington but no discriminating observer would have characterized his beauty as manly it conveyed no impression of strength but did possess a certain element feline rather than feminine which subtly negatived the idea of manliness

he gave his hand to the major nodded curtly to ellis saluted his grandfather respectfully and inquired for the ladies

 olivia is dressing for dinner replied the major  mrs ochiltree is in the kitchen struggling with the servants clara â ah here she comes now  

ellis whose senses were preternaturally acute where clara was concerned was already looking toward the hall and was the first to see her clad in an evening gown of simple white to the closefitting corsage of which she had fastened a bunch of pink roses she was to ellis a dazzling apparition to him her erect and wellmoulded form was the embodiment of symmetry her voice sweet music her movements the perfection of grace and it scarcely needed a lovers imagination to read in her fair countenance a pure heart and a high spirit â the truthfulness that scorns a lie the pride which is not haughtiness there were suggestive depths of tenderness too in the curl of her lip the droop of her long lashes the glance of her blue eyes â depths that ellis had long since divined though he had never yet explored them she gave ellis a friendly nod as she came in but for the smile with which she greeted delamere ellis would have given all that he possessed â not a great deal it is true but what could a man do more 

 you are the last one tom she said reproachfully  mr ellis has been here half an hour

delamere threw a glance at ellis which was not exactly friendly why should this fellow always be on hand to emphasize his own shortcomings 

 the rector is not here answered tom triumphantly  you see i am not the last

 the rector replied clara  was called out of town at six oclock this evening to visit a dying man and so cannot be here you are the last tom and mr ellis was the first

ellis was ruefully aware that this comparison in his favor was the only visible advantage that he had gained from his early arrival he had not seen miss pemberton a moment sooner by reason of it there had been a certain satisfaction in being in the same house with her but delamere had arrived in time to share or more correctly to monopolize the sunshine of her presence

delamere gave a plausible excuse which won claras pardon and another enchanting smile which pierced ellis like a dagger he knew very well that delameres excuse was a lie ellis himself had been ready as early as six oclock but judging this to be too early had stopped in at the clarendon club for half an hour to look over the magazines while coming out he had glanced into the cardroom where he had seen his rival deep in a game of cards from which delamere had evidently not been able to tear himself until the last moment he had accounted for his lateness by a story quite inconsistent with these facts

the two young people walked over to a window on the opposite side of the large room where they stood talking to one another in low tones the major had left the room for a moment old mr delamere who was watching his grandson and clara with an indulgent smile proceeded to rub salt into elliss wounds

 they make a handsome couple he observed  i remember well when her mother in her youth an ideally beautiful woman of an excellent family married daniel pemberton who was not of so good a family but had made money the major who was only a very young man then disapproved of the match he considered that his mother although a widow and nearly forty was marrying beneath her but he has been a good brother to clara and a careful guardian of her estate ah young gentleman you cannot appreciate except in imagination what it means to one standing on the brink of eternity to feel sure that he will live on in his children and his childrens children 

ellis was appreciating at that moment what it meant in cold blood with no effort of the imagination to see the girl whom he loved absorbed completely in another man she had looked at him only once since tom delamere had entered the room and then merely to use him as a spur with which to prick his favored rival

 yes sir he returned mechanically miss clara is a beautiful young lady

and tom is a good boy â a fine boy returned the old gentleman  i am very well pleased with tom and shall be entirely happy when i see them married

ellis could not echo this sentiment the very thought of this marriage made him miserable he had always understood that the engagement was merely tentative a sort of family understanding subject to confirmation after delamere should have attained his majority which was still a year off and when the major should think clara old enough to marry ellis saw delamere with the eye of a jealous rival and judged him mercilessly â whether correctly or not the sequel will show he did not at all believe that tom delamere would make a fit husband for clara pemberton but his opinion would have had no weight â he could hardly have expressed it without showing his own interest moreover there was no element of the sneak in lee elliss makeup the very fact that he might profit by the others discomfiture left delamere secure so far as he could be affected by anything that ellis might say but ellis did not shrink from a fair fight and though in this one the odds were heavily against him yet so long as this engagement remained indefinite so long indeed as the object of his love was still unwed he would not cease to hope such a sacrifice as this marriage clearly belonged in the catalogue of impossibilities ellis had not lived long enough to learn that impossibilities are merely things of which we have not learned or which we do not wish to happen

sandy returned at the end of a quarter of an hour and dinner was announced mr delamere led the way to the diningroom with mrs ochiltree tom followed with clara the major went to the head of the stairs and came down with mrs carteret upon his arm her beauty rendered more delicate by the pallor of her countenance and more complete by the happiness with which it glowed ellis went in alone in the rectors absence it was practically a family party which sat down with the exception of ellis who as we have seen would willingly have placed himself in the same category

the table was tastefully decorated with flowers which grew about the house in lavish profusion in warm climates nature adorns herself with true feminine vanity

 what a beautiful table   exclaimed tom before they were seated

 the decorations are mine said clara proudly  i cut the flowers and arranged them all myself

 which accounts for the admirable effect rejoined tom with a bow before ellis to whom the same thought had occurred was able to express himself he had always counted himself the least envious of men but for this occasion he coveted tom delameres readiness

 the beauty of the flowers observed old mr delamere with sententious gallantry  is reflected upon all around them it is a handsome company mrs ochiltree beamed upon the table with a dry smile

 i dont perceive any effect that it has upon you or me she said and as for the young people  handsome is as handsome does if tom here for instance were as good as he looks  â  you flatter me aunt polly tom broke in hastily anticipating the crack of the whip he was familiar with his aunts conversational idiosyncrasies

 if you are as good as you look continued the old lady with a cunning but indulgent smile some one has been slandering you

 thanks aunt polly  now you dont flatter me there is mr ellis mrs ochiltree went on  who is not half so goodlooking but is steady as a clock i dare say

 now aunt polly interposed mrs carteret  let the gentlemen alone

 she doesnt mean half what she says continued mrs carteret apologetically and only talks that way to people whom she likes

tom threw mrs carteret a grateful glance he had been apprehensive with the sensitiveness of youth lest his old greataunt should make a fool of him before claras family nor had he relished the comparison with ellis who was out of place anyway in this family party he had never liked the fellow who was too much of a plodder and a prig to make a suitable associate for a wholesouled generoushearted young gentleman he tolerated him as a visitor at carterets and as a member of the clarendon club but that was all

 mrs ochiltree has a characteristic way of disguising her feelings observed old mr delamere with a touch of sarcasm

ellis had merely flushed and felt uncomfortable at the reference to himself the compliment to his character hardly offset the reflection upon his looks he knew he was not exactly handsome but it was not pleasant to have the fact emphasized in the presence of the girl he loved he would like at least fair play and judgment upon the subject left to the young lady

mrs ochiltree was quietly enjoying herself in early life she had been accustomed to impale fools on epigrams like flies on pins to see them wriggle but with advancing years she had lost in some measure the faculty of nice discrimination â it was pleasant to see her victims squirm whether they were fools or friends

even ones friends she argued were not always wise and were sometimes the better for being told the truth at her nieces table she felt at liberty to speak her mind which she invariably did with a frankness that sometimes bordered on brutality she had long ago outgrown the period where ambition or passion or its partners envy and hatred were springs of action in her life and simply retained a mild enjoyment in the exercise of an old habit with no active malice whatever the ruling passion merely grew stronger as the restraining faculties decreased in vigor

a diversion was created at this point by the appearance of old mammy jane dressed in a calico frock with clean white neckerchief and apron carrying the wonderful baby in honor of whose naming this feast had been given though only six weeks old the little theodore had grown rapidly and mammy jane declared was already quite large for his age and displayed signs of an unusually precocious intelligence he was passed around the table and duly admired clara thought his hair was fine ellis inquired about his teeth tom put his finger in the babys fist to test his grip old mr delamere was unable to decide as yet whether he favored most his father or his mother the object of these attentions endured them patiently for several minutes and then protested with a vocal vigor which led to his being taken  promptly back upstairs whatever fate might be in store for him he manifested no sign of weak lungs

 sandy said mrs carteret when the baby had retired  pass that tray standing upon the side table so that we may all see the presents

mr delamere had brought a silver spoon and tom a napkin ring ellis had sent a silver watch  it was a little premature he admitted but the boy would grow to it and could use it to play with in the mean time it had a glass back so that he might see the wheels go round mrs ochiltrees present was an old and yellow ivory rattle with a handle which the child could bite while teething and a knob screwed on at the end to prevent the handle from slipping through the babys hand

 i saw that in your cedar chest aunt polly said clara  when i was a little girl and you used to pull the chest out from under your bed to get me a dime

 you kept the rattle in the righthand corner of the chest said tom  in the box with the red silk purse from which you took the gold piece you gave me every christmas

a smile shone on mrs ochiltrees severe features at this appreciation like a ray of sunlight on a snowbank

aunt pollys chest is like the widows cruse said mrs carteret  which was never empty

 or fortunatuss purse which was always full added old mr delamere who read the latin poets and whose allusions were apt to be classical rather than scriptural

 it will last me while i live said mrs ochiltree adding cautiously  but therell not be a great deal left it wont take much to support an old woman for twenty years

mr delameres man sandy had been waiting upon the table with the decorum of a trained butler and a gravity all his own he had changed his suit of plain gray for a long blue coat with brass buttons which dated back to the fashion of a former generation with which he wore a pair of plaid trousers of strikingly modern cut and pattern with his whiskers his spectacles and his solemn air of responsibility he would have presented to one unfamiliar with the negro type an amusingly impressive appearance but there was nothing incongruous about sandy to this company except perhaps to tom delamere who possessed a keen eye for contrasts and always regarded sandy in that particular rig as a very comical darkey

 is it quite prudent mrs ochiltree suggested the major at a moment when sandy having set down the tray had left the room for a little while  to mention in the presence of the servants that you keep money in the house  

 i beg your pardon major observed old mr delamere with a touch of stiffness  the only servant in hearing of the conversation has been my own and sandy is as honest as any man in wellington

 you mean sir replied carteret with a smile  as honest as any negro in wellington

i make no exceptions major returned the old gentleman with emphasis  i would trust sandy with my life â he saved it once at the risk of his own

 no doubt mused the major  the negro is capable of a certain doglike fidelity â i make the comparison in a kindly sense â a certain personal devotion which is admirable in itself and fits him eminently for a servile career i should imagine however that one could more safely trust his life with a negro than his portable property

 very clever major i read your paper and know that your feeling is hostile toward the negro but  â

the major made a gesture of dissent but remained courteously silent until mr delamere had finished

 for my part the old gentleman went on  i think they have done very well considering what they started from and their limited opportunities there was adam miller for instance who left a comfortable estate his son george carries on the business and the younger boy william is a good doctor and stands well with his profession his hospital is a good thing and if my estate were clear i should like to do something for it

 you are mistaken sir in imagining me hostile to the negro explained carteret  on the contrary i am friendly to his best interests i give him employment i pay taxes for schools to educate him and for courthouses and jails to keep him in order i merely object to being governed by an inferior and servile race

mrs carterets face wore a tired expression this question was her husbands hobby and therefore her own nightmare moreover she had her personal grievance against the negro race and the names mentioned by old mr delamere had brought it vividly before her mind she had no desire to mar the harmony of the occasion by the discussion of a distasteful subject

mr delamere glancing at his hostess read something of this thought and refused the challenge to further argument

 i do not believe major he said  that olivia relishes the topic i merely wish to say that sandy is an exception to any rule which you may formulate in derogation of the negro sandy is a gentleman in ebony 

tom could scarcely preserve his gravity at this characterization of old sandy with his ridiculous air of importance his long blue coat and his loud plaid trousers that suit would make a great costume for a masquerade he would borrow it some time â there was nothing in the world like it

 well mr delamere returned the major goodhumoredly  no doubt sandy is an exceptionally good negro â he might well be for he has had the benefit of your example all his life â and we know that he is a faithful servant but nevertheless if i were mrs ochiltree i should put my money in the bank not all negroes are as honest as sandy and an elderly lady might not prove a match for a burly black burglar

 thank you major retorted mrs ochiltree with spirit  im not yet too old to take care of myself that cedar chest has been my bank for forty years and i shall not change my habits at my age

at this moment sandy reentered the room carteret made a warning gesture which mrs ochiltree chose not to notice

 ive proved a match for two husbands and am not afraid of any man that walks the earth black or white by day or night i have a revolver and know how to use it whoever attempts to rob me will do so at his peril

after dinner clara played the piano and sang duets with tom delamere at nine oclock mr delameres carriage came for him and he went away accompanied by sandy under cover of the darkness the old gentleman leaned on his servants arm with frank dependence and sandy lifted him into the carriage with every mark of devotion

ellis had already excused himself to go to the office and look over the late proofs for the morning paper tom remained a few minutes longer than his grandfather and upon taking his leave went round to the clarendon club where he spent an hour or two in the cardroom with a couple of congenial friends luck seemed to favor him and he went home at midnight with a comfortable balance of winnings he was fond of excitement and found a great deal of it in cards to lose was only less exciting than to win of late he had developed into a very successful player â so successful indeed that several members of the club generally found excuses to avoid participating in a game where he made one

to go back a little for several days after his childs birth major carterets chief interest in life had been confined to the four walls of the chamber where his pale wife lay upon her bed of pain and those of the adjoining room where an old black woman crooned lovingly over a little white infant a new element had been added to the majors consciousness broadening the scope and deepening the strength of his affections he did not love olivia the less for maternity had crowned her wifehood with an added glory but side by side with this old and tried attachment was a new passion stirring up dormant hopes and kindling new desires his regret had been more than personal at the thought that with himself an old name should be lost to the state  and now all the old pride of race class and family welled up anew and swelled and quickened the current of his life

upon the majors first appearance at the office which took place the second day after the childs birth he opened a box of cigars in honor of the event the word had been passed around by ellis and the whole office force including reporters compositors and pressmen came in to congratulate the major and smoke at his expense even jerry the colored porter â mammy janes grandson and therefore a protege of the familyâ presented himself among the rest or rather after the rest the major shook hands with them all except jerry though he acknowledged the porters congratulations with a kind nod and put a good cigar into his outstretched palm for which jerry thanked him without manifesting any consciousness of the omission he was quite aware that under ordinary circumstances the major would not have shaken hands with white workingmen to say nothing of negroes and he had merely hoped that in the pleasurable distraction of the moment the major might also overlook the distinction of color jerrys hope had been shattered though not rudely for the major had spoken pleasantly and the cigar was a good one mr ellis had once shaken hands with jerry â but mr ellis was a young man whose quaker father had never owned any slaves and he could not be expected to have as much pride as one of the best  quality whose families had possessed land and negroes for time out of mind on the whole jerry preferred the careless nod of the editorinchief to the more familiar greeting of the subaltern

having finished this pleasant ceremony which left him with a comfortable sense of his new dignity the major turned to his desk it had been much neglected during the week and more than one matter claimed his attention but as typical of the new trend of his thoughts the first subject he took up was one bearing upon the future of his son quite obviously the career of a carteret must not be left to chance â it must be planned and worked out with a due sense of the value of good blood

there lay upon his desk a letter from a wellknown promoter offering the major an investment which promised large returns though several years must elapse before the enterprise could be put upon a pay ing basis the element of time however was not immediately important the morning chronicle provided him an ample income the money available for this investment was part of his wifes patrimony it was invested in a local cotton mill which was paying ten per cent but this was a beggarly return compared with the immense profits promised by the offered investment â profits which would enable his son upon reaching manhood to take a place in the world commensurate with the dignity of his ancestors one of whom only a few generations removed had owned an estate of ninety thousand acres of land and six thousand slaves

this letter having been disposed of by an answer accepting the offer the major took up his pen to write an editorial public affairs in the state were not going to his satisfaction at the last state election his own party after an almost unbroken rule of twenty years had been defeated by the socalled fusion ticket a combination of republicans and populists a clean sweep had been made of the offices in the state which were now filled by new men many of the smaller places had gone to colored men their people having voted almost solidly for the fusion ticket in spite of the fact that the population of wellington was two thirds colored this state of things was gall and wormwood to the defeated party of which the morning chronicle was the acknowledged organ major carteret shared this feeling only this very morning while passing the city hall on his way to the office he had seen the steps of that noble building disfigured by a fringe of jobhunting negroes for all the world â to use a local simile â like a string of buzzards sitting on a rail awaiting their opportunity to batten upon the helpless corpse of a moribund city

taking for his theme the unfitness of the negro to participate in government â an unfitness due to his limited education his lack of experience his criminal tendencies and more especially to his hopeless mental and physical inferiority to the white race âthe major had demonstrated it seemed to him clearly enough that the ballot in the hands of the negro was a menace to the commonwealth he had argued with entire conviction that the white and black races could never attain social and political harmony by commingling their blood he had proved by several historical parallels that no two unassimilable races could ever live together except in the relation of superior and inferior  and he was just dipping his gold pen into the ink to indite his conclusions from the premises thus established when jerry the porter announced two visitors

 ginl belmont an capn mc bane would like ter see you suh

 show them in jerry

the man who entered first upon this invitation was a dapper little gentleman with lightblue eyes and a vandyke beard he wore a frock coat patent leather shoes and a panama hat there were crowsfeet about his eyes which twinkled with a hard and at times humorous shrewdness he had sloping shoulders small hands and feet and walked with the leisurely step characteristic of those who have been reared under hot suns

carteret gave his hand cordially to the gentleman thus described

 how do you do captain mc bane he said turning to the second visitor

the individual thus addressed was strikingly different in appearance from his companion his broad shoulders burly form square jaw and heavy chin betokened strength energy and unscrupulousness with the exception of a small bristling mustache his face was clean shaven with here and there a speck of dried blood due to a carelessly or unskillfully handled razor a single deepset gray eye was shadowed by a beetling brow over which a crop of coarse black hair slightly streaked with gray fell almost low enough to mingle with his black bushy eyebrows his coat had not been brushed for several days if one might judge from the accumulation of dandruff upon the collar and his shirtfront in the middle of which blazed a showy diamond was plentifully stained with tobacco juice he wore a large slouch hat which upon entering the office he removed and held in his hand

having greeted this person with an unconscious but quite perceptible diminution of the warmth with which he had welcomed the other the major looked around the room for seats for his visitors and perceiving only one chair piled with exchanges and a broken stool propped against the wall pushed a button which rang a bell in the hall summoning the colored porter to his presence

 jerry said the editor when his servant appeared  bring a couple of chairs for these gentlemen

while they stood waiting the visitors congratulated the major on the birth of his child which had been announced in the morning chronicle and which the prominence of the family made in some degree a matter of public interest

 and now that you have a son major remarked the gentleman first described as he lit one of the majors cigars  youll be all the more interested in doing something to make this town fit to live in which is what we came up to talk about things are in an awful condition  a negro justice of the peace has opened an office on market street and only yesterday summoned a white man to appear before him negro lawyers get most of the business in the criminal court last evening a group of young white ladies going quietly along the street arminarm were forced off the sidewalk by a crowd of negro girls coming down the street just now i saw a spectacle of social equality and negro domination that made my blood boil with indignation â a white and a black convict chained together crossing the city in charge of a negro officer  we cannot stand that sort of thing carteret â it is the last straw something must be done and that quickly  

the major thrilled with responsive emotion there was something prophetic in this opportune visit the matter was not only in his own thoughts but in the air it was the spontaneous revulsion of white men against the rule of an inferior race these were the very men above all others in the town to join him in a movement to change these degrading conditions

general belmont the smaller of the two was a man of good family a lawyer by profession and took an active part in state and local politics aristocratic by birth and instinct and a former owner of slaves his conception of the obligations and rights of his caste was nevertheless somewhat lower than that of the narrower but more sincere carteret in serious affairs carteret desired the approval of his conscience even if he had to trick that docile organ into acquiescence this was not difficult to do in politics for he believed in the divine right of white men and gentlemen as his ancestors had believed in and died for the divine right of kings general belmont was not without a gentlemans distaste for meanness but he permitted no fine scruples to stand in the way of success he had once been minister under a democratic administration to a small central american state political rivals had characterized him as a tricky demagogue which may of course have been a libel he had an amiable disposition possessed the gift of eloquence and was a prime social favorite

captain george mc bane had sprung from the poorwhite class to which even more than to the slaves the abolition of slavery had opened the door of opportunity no longer overshadowed by a slaveholding caste some of this class had rapidly pushed themselves forward some had made honorable records others foremost in negrobaiting and election frauds had done the dirty work of politics as their fathers had done that of slavery seeking their reward at first in minor offices â for which men of gentler breeding did not care â until their ambition began to reach out for higher honors

of this class mc bane â whose captaincy by the way was merely a polite fiction â had been one of the most successful he had held until recently as the reward of questionable political services a contract with the state for its convict labor from which in a few years he had realized a fortune but the methods which made his contract profitable had not commended themselves to humane people and charges of cruelty and worse had been preferred against him he was rich enough to escape serious consequences from the investigation which followed but when the fusion ticket carried the state he lost his contract and the system of convict labor was abolished since then mc bane had devoted himself to politics he was ambitious for greater wealth for office and for social recognition a man of few words and selfengrossed he seldom spoke of his aspirations except where speech might favor them preferring to seek his ends by secret  deals  and combinations rather than to challenge criticism and provoke rivalry by more open methods

at sight therefore of these two men with whose careers and characters he was entirely familiar carteret felt sweep over his mind the conviction that now was the time and these the instruments with which to undertake the redemption of the state from the evil fate which had befallen it

jerry the porter who had gone downstairs to the countingroom to find two whole chairs now entered with one in each hand he set a chair for the general who gave him an amiable nod to which jerry responded with a bow and a scrape captain mc bane made no acknowledgment but fixed jerry so fiercely with his single eye that upon placing the chair jerry made his escape from the room as rapidly as possible

 i don like dat capn mc bane he muttered upon reaching the hall  dey says he got dat eye knock out tryin ter whip a cullud oman when he wuz a boy an dat he ain never had no use fer niggers sence â cepn fer what he could make outen em wid his convic labor contracs his daddy wuz a overseer befo im an it come nachul fer him ter be a niggerdriver i don want dat one eye er hisn restin on me no longer n i kin hep an i don know how im gwine ter like dis job ef hes gwine ter be comin roun here he ain nothin but po wite trash nohow but lawd  lawd look at de money he s got â livin at de hotel wearin dimons an colloguin wid de bes quality er dis town pears ter me de bottom rail is gittin mighty close ter de top well i spose it all comes fm bein wite i wush ter gawd i wuz wite 

after this fervent aspiration having nothing else to do for the time being except to remain within call and having caught a few words of the conversation as he went in with the chairs jerry who possessed a certain amount of curiosity placed close to the wall the broken stool upon which he sat while waiting in the hall and applied his ear to a hole in the plastering of the hallway there was a similar defect in the inner wall between the same two pieces of studding and while this inner opening was not exactly opposite the outer jerry was enabled through the two to catch in a more or less fragmentary way what was going on within

he could hear the major now and then use the word  negro and mc banes deep voice was quite audible when he referred it seemed to jerry with alarming frequency to  the damned niggers while the generals suave tones now and then pronounced the word  niggro  â a sort of compromise between ethnology and the vernacular that the gentlemen were talking politics seemed quite likely for gentlemen generally talked politics when they met at the chronicle office jerry could hear the words  vote  franchise  eliminate  constitution and other expressions which marked the general tenor of the talk though he could not follow it all â partly because he could not hear everything distinctly and partly because of certain limitations which nature had placed in the way of jerrys understanding anything very difficult or abstruse

he had gathered enough however to realize in a vague way that something serious was on foot involving his own race when a bell sounded over his head at which he sprang up hastily and entered the room where the gentlemen were talking

jerry said the major wait on captain mcbane

 yas suh responded jerry turning toward the captain whose eye he carefully avoided meeting directly

 take that half a dollar boy ordered mc bane  an go cross the street to mr sykess and tell him to send me three whiskies bring back the change and make hase

the captain tossed the half dollar at jerry who looking to one side of course missed it he picked the money up however and backed out of the room jerry did not like captain mc bane to begin with and it was clear that the captain was no gentleman or ho would not have thrown the money at him considering the source jerry might have overlooked this discourtesy had it not been coupled with the remark about the change which seemed to him in very poor taste

returning in a few minutes with three glasses on a tray he passed them round handed captain mc bane his change and retired to the hall

 gentlemen exclaimed the captain lifting his glass  i propose a toast  no nigger domination 

 amen  said the others and three glasses were solemnly drained

 major observed the general smacking his lips  i should like to use jerry for a moment if you will permit me

jerry appeared promptly at the sound of the bell ite had remained conveniently near â calls of this sort were apt to come in sequence

jerry said the general handing jerry half a dollar go over to mr browns â i get my liquor there â and tell them to send me three glasses of my special mixture and jerryâ you may keep the change 

 thank y ginl thank y marster replied jerry with unctuous gratitude bending almost double as he backed out of the room

 dat s a genteman a rale oletime genteman he said to himself when he had closed the door  but dere s somethin gwine on in dere â dere sho is  no nigger damnation   dat souns all right â im sho dere ain no nigger i knows wat wants damnation do deres lots of em wat deserves it but ef dat oneeyed capll mc bane got anything ter do wid it watever it is it don mean no good fer de niggers â damnationd be better fer em dan dat capn mc bane  he looks at a nigger lack he could jes eat im alive

 this mixture gentlemen observed the general when jerry had returned with the glasses was originally compounded by no less a person than the great john c calhoun himself who confided the recipe to my father over the convivial board in this nectar of the gods gentlemen i drink with you to  white supremacy  

 white supremacy everywhere   added mc bane with fervor

 now and forever   concluded carteret solemnly

when the visitors half an hour later had taken their departure carteret inspired by the theme and in less degree by the famous mixture of the immortal calhoun turned to his desk and finished at a white heat his famous editorial in which he sounded the tocsin of a new crusade

at noon when the editor having laid down his pen was leaving the office he passed jerry in the hall without a word or a nod the major wore a rapt look which jerry observed with a vague uneasiness

 he looks jes lack he wuz walkin in his sleep muttered jerry uneasily  deres somethin up shos you bawn  no nigger damnation   anybodyd low dey wuz all gwine ter heaven  but i knows better wen a passel er wite folks gits ter talkin bout de niggers lack dem in yander its mo lackly deyre gwine ter ketch somethin ese dan heaven i got ter keep my eyes open an keep up wid wats happenin ef deres gwine ter be anudder flood roun here i wants ter git in de ark wid de wite folks â i may haf ter be anudder ham an stat de cullud race all over agin

the young heir of the carterets had thriven apace and at six months old was according to mammy jane whose experience qualified her to speak with authority the largest finest smartest and altogether most remarkable baby that had ever lived in wellington mammy jane had recently suffered from an attack of inflammatory rheumatism as the result of which she had returned to her own home she nevertheless came now and then to see mrs carteret a younger nurse had been procured to take her place but it was understood that jane would come whenever she might be needed

 you really mean that about dodie do you mammy jane   asked the delighted mother who never tired of hearing her own opinion confirmed concerning this wonderful child which had come to her like an angel from heaven

 does i mean it  exclaimed mammy jane with a tone and an expression which spoke volumes of reproach  now mis livy what is i ever uttered er said er spoke er done dat would make you spose i could tell you a lie bout yo own chile  

 no mammy jane i m sure you wouldnt

 deed maam im tellin you de lawds truf i don haf ter tell no lies ner strain no pints bout my ole mistesss granchile dis yer boy is de vey spit an image er yo brother young mars alick wat died wen he wuz bout eight monts ole wiles i wuz laid off havin a baby er my own an could n be roun ter look after im an dis chile is a rale quality chile he is â i never seed a baby wid sech fine hair fer his age ner sech blue eyes ner sech a grip ner sech a heft wy dat chile mus weigh bout twentyfo pouns an he not but six monts ole does dat gal wat does de nussin wiles im gone ten ter dis chile right mis livy  

 she does fairly well mammy jane but i could hardly expect her to love the baby as you do theres no one like you mammy jane

 deed dere aint honey you is talkin de gospel truf now none er dese yer young folks ain got de trainin my ole mistess give me dese yer newfangle schools don larn em nothin ter compare wid it im jes gwine ter give dat gal a piece er my min befo i go so syoull ten ter dis chile right

the nurse came in shortly afterwards a neatlooking brown girl dressed in a clean calico gown with a nurses cap and apron

 look ahere gal said mammy jane sternly  i wants you ter understan dat you got ter take good keer er dis chile  fer i nussed his mammy dere an his granmammy befo im an you is got a priviege dat mos lackly you don preciate i wants you to member in yo incomins an outgoins dat i got my eye on you an am gwine ter see dat you does yo wok right

do you need me for anything maam asked the young nurse who had stood before mrs carteret giving mammy jane a mere passing glance and listening impassively to her harangue the nurse belonged to the younger generation of colored people she had graduated from the mission school and had received some instruction in dr millers class for nurses standing like most young people of her race on the border line between two irreconcilable states of life she had neither the picturesqueness of the slave nor the unconscious dignity of those of whom freedom has been the immemorial birthright she was in what might be called the chipontheshoulder stage through which races as well as individuals must pass in climbing the ladder of life â not an interesting at least not an agreeable stage but an inevitable one and for that reason entitled to a paragraph in a story of southern life which with its as yet imperfect blending of old with new of race with race of slavery with freedom is like no other life under the sun

had this old woman who had no authority over her been a little more polite or a little less offensive the nurse might have returned her a pleasant answer these oldtime negroes she said to herself made her sick with their slavering over the white folks who she supposed favored them and made much of them because they had once belonged to them â much the same reason why they fondled their cats and dogs for her own part they gave her nothing but her wages and small wages at that and she owed them nothing more than equivalent service it was purely a matter of business  she sold her time for their money there was no question of love between them

receiving a negative answer from mrs carteret she left the room without a word ignoring mammy jane completely and leaving that venerable relic of antebellum times gasping in helpless astonishment

 well i nevuh  she ejaculated as soon as she could get her breath  ef dat ain de beatinis pefomance i ever seed er heared of  dese yer young niggers ain got de manners dey wuz bawned wid i don know wat deyre comin to wen dey ain got no mo rispec fer ole age â i don knowâi don know 

 now what are you croaking about jane   asked major carteret who came into the room and took the child into his arms

mammy jane hobbled to her feet and bobbed a curtsy she was never lacking in respect to white people of proper quality but major carteret the quintessence of aristocracy called out all her reserves of deference the major was always kind and considerate to these old family retainers brought up in the feudal atmosphere now so rapidly passing away mammy jane loved mrs carteret toward the major she entertained a feeling bordering upon awe

 well jane returned the major sadly when the old nurse had related her grievance  the old times have vanished the old ties have been ruptured the old relations of dependence and loyal obedience on the part of the colored people the responsibility of protection and kindness upon that of the whites have passed away forever the young negroes are too selfassertive education is spoiling them jane they have been badly taught they are not content with their station in life some time they will overstep the mark the white people are patient but there is a limit to their endurance

 dats wat i tells dese young niggers groaned mammy jane with a portentous shake of her turbaned head  wen i hears em gwine on wid deir foolishniss but dey don min me dey lows dey knows mo dn i does case dey ben larnt ter look in a book but pshuli my ole mistess showed me mo dn dem niggersll larn in a thousan years  is fetch my granson jerry up ter be umble an keep in is place an i tells dese other niggers dat ef deyd do de same an not crowd de wite folks dey d git ernuff ter eat an live out deir days in peace an comfot but dey don min me â dey don min me 

 if all the colored people were like you and jerry jane rejoined the major kindly  there would never be any trouble you have friends upon whom in time of need you can rely implicitly for protection and succor you served your mistress faithfully before the war  you remained by her when the other negroes were running hither and thither like sheep without a shepherd  and you have transferred your allegiance to my wife and her child we think a great deal of you jane

yes indeed mammy jane assented mrs carteret with sincere affection glancing with moist eyes from the child in her husbands arms to the old nurse whose dark face was glowing with happiness at these expressions of appreciation  you shall never want so long as we have anything we would share our last crust with you

thank y mis livy said jane with reciprocal emotion  i knows who my friens is an i ain gwine ter let nothin worry me but fer de lawds sake mars philip gimme dat chile an lemme pat im on de back er youll choke hissef ter death 

the old nurse had been the first to observe that little dodie for some reason was gasping for breath catching the child from the majors arms she patted it on the back and shook it gently after a moment of this treatment the child ceased to gasp but still breathed heavily with a strange whistling noise

 oh my child  exclaimed the mother in great alarm taking the baby in her own arms  what can be the matter with him mammy jane

 fer de lawds sake maam i don know less hes swallered somethin an he ain had nothin in his hans but de rattle mis polly give im

mrs carteret caught up the ivory rattle which hung suspended by a ribbon from the babys neck

 he has swallowed the little piece off the end of the handle she cried turning pale with fear  and it has lodged in his throat telephone dr price to come immediately philip before my baby chokes to death oh my baby my precious baby  

an anxious half hour passed during which the child lay quiet except for its labored breathing the suspense was relieved by the arrival of dr price who examined the child carefully

 its a curious accident he announced at the close of his inspection  so far as i can discover the piece of ivory has been drawn into the trachea or windpipe and has lodged in the mouth of the right bronchus ill try to get it out without an operation but i cant guarantee the result

at the end of another half hour dr price announced his inability to remove the obstruction without resorting to more serious measures

 i do not see he declared  how an operation can be avoided

 will it be dangerous   inquired the major anxiously while mrs carteret shivered at the thought

 it will be necessary to cut into his throat from the outside all such operations are more or less dangerous especially on small children if this were some other child i might undertake the operation unassisted but i know how you value this one major and i should prefer to share the responsibility with a specialist

 is there one in town   asked the major

 no but we can get one from out of town

 send for the best one in the country said the major  who can be got here in time spare no expense dr price we value this child above any earthly thing

 the best is the safest replied dr price  i will send for dr burns of philadelphia the best surgeon in that line in america if he can start at once he can reach here in sixteen or eighteen hours and the case can wait even longer if inflammation does not set in

the message was dispatched forthwith by rare good fortune the eminent specialist was able to start within an hour or two after the receipt of dr prices telegram meanwhile the baby remained restless and uneasy the doctor spending most of his time by its side mrs carteret who had never been quite strong since the childs birth was a prey to the most agonizing apprehensions

mammy jane while not presuming to question the opinion of dr price and not wishing to add to her mistresss distress was secretly oppressed by forebodings which she was unable to shake off the child was born for bad luck the mole under its ear just at the point where the hangmans knot would strike had foreshadowed dire misfortune she had already observed several little things which had rendered her vaguely anxious

for instance upon one occasion on entering the room where the baby had been left alone asleep in his crib she had met a strange cat hurrying from the nursery and upon examining closely the pillow upon which the child lay had found a depression which had undoubtedly been due to the weight of the cats body the child was restless and uneasy and jane had ever since believed that the cat had been sucking little dodies breath with what might have been fatal results had she not appeared just in the nick of time

this untimely accident of the rattle a fatality for which no one could be held responsible had confirmed the unlucky omen janes duties in the nursery did not permit her to visit her friend the conjure woman  but she did find time to go out in the back yard at dusk and to dig up the charm which she had planted there it had protected the child so far but perhaps its potency had become exhausted she picked up the bottle shook it vigorously and then laid it back with the other side up refilling the hole she made a cross over the top with the thumb of her left hand and walked three times around it

what this strange symbolism meant or whence it derived its origin aunt jane did not know the cross was there and the trinity though jane was scarcely conscious of these at this moment as religious emblems but she hoped on general principles that this performance would strengthen the charm and restore little dodies luck it certainly had its moral effect upon janes own mind for she was able to sleep better and contrived to impress mrs carteret with her own hopefulness

as the southbound train was leaving the station at philadelphia a gentleman took his seat in the single sleepingcar attached to the train and proceeded to make himself comfortable he hung up his hat and opened his newspaper in which he remained absorbed for a quarter of an hour when the train had left the city behind he threw the paper aside and looked around at the other occupants of the car one of these who had been on the car since it had left new york rose from his seat upon perceiving the others glance and came down the aisle

how do you do dr burns he said stopping beside the seat of the philadelphia passenger

the gentleman looked up at the speaker with an air of surprise which after the first keen incisive glance gave place to an expression of cordial recognition

 why its miller  he exclaimed rising and giving the other his hand  william millerâdr miller of course sit down miller and tell me all about yourself â what youre doing where youve been and where youre going im delighted to meet you and to see you looking so well â and so prosperous

 i deserve no credit for either sir returned the other as he took the proffered seat  for i inherited both health and prosperity it is a fortunate chance that permits me to meet you

the two acquaintances thus opportunely thrown together so that they might while away in conversation the tedium of their journey represented very different and yet very similar types of manhood a celebrated traveler after many years spent in barbarous or savage lands has said that among all varieties of mankind the similarities are vastly more important and fundamental than the differences looking at these two men with the american eye the differences would perhaps be the more striking or at least the more immediately apparent for the first was white and the second black or more correctly speaking brown  it was even a light brown but both his swarthy complexion and his curly hair revealed what has been described in the laws of some of our states as a  visible admixture  of african blood

having disposed of this difference and having observed that the white man was perhaps fifty years of age and the other not more than thirty it may be said that they were both tall and sturdy both well dressed the white man with perhaps a little more distinction  both seemed from their faces and their manners to be men of culture and accustomed to the society of cultivated people they were both handsome men the elder representing a fine type of anglosaxon as the term is used in speaking of our composite white population  while the mulattos erect form broad shoulders clear eyes fine teeth and pleasingly moulded features showed nowhere any sign of that degeneration which the pessimist so sadly maintains is the inevitable heritage of mixed races

as to their personal relations it has already appeared that they were members of the same profession in past years they had been teacher and pupil dr

alvin burns was professor in the famous medical college where miller had attended lectures the professor had taken an interest in his only colored pupil to whom he had been attracted by his earnestness of purpose his evident talent and his excellent manners and fine physique it was in part due to dr burnss friendship that miller had won a scholarship which had enabled him without drawing too heavily upon his fathers resources to spend in europe studying in the hospitals of paris and vienna the two most delightful years of his life the same influence had strengthened his natural inclination toward operative surgery in which dr burns was a distinguished specialist of national reputation

millers father adam miller had been a thrifty colored man the son of a slave who in the olden time had bought himself with money which he had earned and saved over and above what he had paid his master for his time adam miller had inherited his fathers thrift as well as his trade which was that of a stevedore or contractor for the loading and unloading of vessels at the port of wellington in the flush turpentine days following a few years after the civil war he had made money his savings shrewdly invested had by constant accessions become a competence he had brought up his eldest son to the trade  the other he had given a professional education in the proud hope that his children or his grandchildren might be gentlemen in the town where their ancestors had once been slaves

upon his fathers death shortly after dr millers return from europe and a year or two before the date at which this story opens he had promptly spent part of his inheritance in founding a hospital to which was to be added a training school for nurses and in time perhaps a medical college and a school of pharmacy he had been strongly tempted to leave the south and seek a home for his family and a career for himself in the freer north where race antagonism was less keen or at least less oppressive or in europe where he had never found his color work to his disadvantage but his people had needed him and he had wished to help them and had sought by means of this institution to contribute to their uplifting as he now informed dr burns he was returning from new york where he had been in order to purchase equipment for his new hospital which would soon be ready for the reception of patients

 how much i can accomplish i do not know said miller  but ill do what i can there are eight or nine million of us and it will take a great deal of learning of all kinds to leaven that lump

 it is a great problem miller the future of your race returned the other  a tremendously interesting problem it is a serial story which we are all reading and which grows in vital interest with each successive installment it is not only your problem but ours your race must come up or drag ours down we shall come up declared miller  slowly and painfully perhaps but we shall win our way if our race had made as much progress everywhere as they have made in wellington the problem would be well on the way toward solution

wellington exclaimed dr burns thats where im going a dr price of wellington has sent for me to perform an operation on a childs throat do you know dr price  

quite well replied miller he is a friend of mine

 so much the better i shall want you to assist me i read in the medical gazette the other day an account of a very interesting operation of yours i felt proud to number you among my pupils it was a remarkable case â a rare case i must certainly have you with me in this one

i shall be delighted sir returned miller  if it is agreeable to all concerned

several hours were passed in pleasant conversation while the train sped rapidly southward they were already far down in virginia and had stopped at a station beyond richmond when the conductor entered the car

 all passengers he announced  will please transfer to the day coaches ahead the sleeper has a hot box and must be switched off here

dr burns and miller obeyed the order the former leading the way into the coach immediately in front of the sleepingcar

 lets sit here miller he said having selected a seat near the rear of the car and deposited his suitcase in a rack  its on the shady side

miller stood a moment hesitatingly but finally took the seat indicated and a few minutes later the journey was again resumed

when the train conductor made his round after leaving the station he paused at the seat occupied by the two doctors glanced interrogatively at miller and then spoke to dr burns who sat in the end of the seat nearest the aisle

this man is with you he asked indicating miller with a slight side movement of his head and a keen glance in his direction

 certainly replied dr burns curtly and with some surprise  dont you see that he is  

the conductor passed on miller paid no apparent attention to this little interlude though no syllable had escaped him he resumed the conversation where it had been broken off but nevertheless followed with his eyes the conductor who stopped at a seat near the forward end of the car and engaged in conversation with a man whom miller had not hitherto noticed

as this passenger turned his head and looked back toward miller the latter saw a broadshouldered burly white man and recognized in his squarecut jaw his coarse firm mouth and the single gray eye with which he swept miller for an instant with a scornful glance a wellknown character of wellington with whom the reader has already made acquaintance in these pages captain mc bane wore a frock coat and a slouch hat several buttons of his vest were unbuttoned and his solitaire diamond blazed in his soiled shirtfront like the headlight of a locomotive

the conductor in his turn looked back at miller and retraced his steps miller braced himself for what he feared was coming though he had hoped on account of his friends presence that it might be avoided

 excuse me sir said the conductor addressing dr burns but did i understand you to say that this man was your servant 

 no indeed   replied dr burns indignantly  the gentleman is not my servant nor anybodys servant but is my friend but by the way since we are on the subject may i ask what affair it is of yours  

 its very much my affair returned the conductor somewhat nettled at this questioning of his authority  im sorry to part friends but the law of virginia does not permit colored passengers to ride in the white cars youll have to go forward to the next coach he added addressing miller this time

 i have paid my fare on the sleepingcar where the separatecar law does not apply remonstrated miller

 i cant help that you can doubtless get your money back from the sleepingcar company but this is a day coach and is distinctly marked  white as you must have seen before you sat down here the sign is put there for that purpose

he indicated a large card neatly framed and hung at the end of the car containing the legend  white in letters about a foot long painted in white upon a dark background typical one might suppose of the distinction thereby indicated

 you shall not stir a step miller exclaimed dr burns wrathfully  this is an outrage upon a citizen of a free country you shall stay right heie

 im sorry to discommode you returned the conductor but theres no use kicking its the law of virginia and i am bound by it as well as you i have already come near losing my place because of not enforcing it and i can take no more such chances since i have a family to support

 and my friend has his rights to maintain returned dr burns with determination  there is a vital principle at stake in the matter

 really sir argued the conductor who was a man of peace and not fond of controversy  theres no use talking â he absolutely cannot ride in this car

 how can you prevent it   asked dr burns lapsing into the argumentative stage

 the law gives me the right to remove him by force i can call on the train crew to assist me or on the other passengers if i should choose to put him off the train entirely in the middle of a swamp he would have no redress â the law so provides if i did not wish to use force i could simply switch this car off at the next siding transfer the white passengers to another and leave you and your friend in possession until you were arrested and fined or imprisoned

 what he says is absolutely true doctor interposed miller at this point  it is the law and we are powerless to resist it if we made any trouble it would merely delay your journey and imperil a life at the other end ill go into the other car

you shall not go alone said dr burns stoutly rising in his turn  a place that is too good for you is not good enough for me i will sit wherever you do  im sorry again said the conductor who had quite recovered his equanimity and calmly conscious of his power could scarcely restrain an amused smile  i dislike to interfere but white passengers are not permitted to ride in the colored car

this is an outrage declared dr burns a dd outrage you are curtailing the rights not only of colored people but of white men as well i shall sit where i please 

 i warn you sir rejoined the conductor hardening again  that the law will be enforced the beauty of the system lies in its strict impartiality â it applies to both races alike

 and is equally infamous in both cases declared dr burns  i shall immediately take steps  â  never mind doctor interrupted miller soothingly  its only for a little while ill reach my destination just as surely in the other car and we cant help it anyway ill see you again at wellington

dr burns finding resistance futile at length acquiesced and made way for miller to pass him

the colored doctor took up his valise and crossed the platform to the car ahead it was an old car with faded upholstery from which the stuffing projected here and there through torn places apparently the floor had not been swept for several days the dust lay thick upon the window sills and the watercooler from which he essayed to get a drink was filled with stale water which had made no recent acquaintance with ice there was no other passenger in the car and miller occupied himself in making a rough calculation of what it would cost the southern railroads to haul a whole car for every colored passenger it was expensive to say the least it would be cheaper and quite as considerate of their feelings to make the negroes walk

the car was conspicuously labeled at either end with large cards similar to those in the other car except that they bore the word  colored  in black letters upon a white background the author of this piece of legislation had contrived with an ingenuity worthy of a better cause that not merely should the passengers be separated by the color line but that the reason for this division should be kept constantly in mind lest a white man should forget that he was whiteâ not a very likely contingency â these cards would keep him constantly admonished of the fact should a colored person endeavor for a moment to lose sight of his disability these staring signs would remind him continually that between him and the rest of mankind not of his own color there was by law a great gulf fixed

having composed himself miller had opened a newspaper and was deep in an editorial which set forth in glowing language the inestimable advantages which would follow to certain recently acquired islands by the introduction of american liberty when the rear door of the car opened to give entrance to captain george mc bane who took a seat near the door and lit a cigar miller knew him quite well by sight and by reputation and detested him as heartily he represented the aggressive offensive element among the white people of the new south who made it hard for a negro to maintain his selfrespect or to enjoy even the rights conceded to colored men by southern laws mc bane had undoubtedly identified him to the conductor in the other car miller had no desire to thrust himself upon the society of white people which indeed to one who had traveled so much and so far was no novelty  but he very naturally resented being at this late day â the law had been in operation only a few months â branded and tagged and set apart from the rest of mankind upon the public highways like an unclean thing nevertheless he preferred even this to the exclusive society of captain george mc bane

 porter he demanded of the colored train attache who passed through the car a moment later  is this a smoking car for white men  

no suh replied the porter but they comes in here sometimes when they ain no cullud ladies on the kyar

 well i have paid firstclass fare and i object to that mans smoking in here you tell him to go out

 ill tell the conductor suh returned the porter in a low tone  id jus as soon talk ter the devil as ter that man

the white man had spread himself over two seats and was smoking vigorously from time to time spitting carelessly in the aisle when the conductor entered the compartment

 captain said miller  this car is plainly marked  colored i have paid firstclass fare and i object to riding in a smoking car

 all right returned the conductor frowning irritably  ill speak to him

he walked over to the white passenger with whom he was evidently acquainted since he adressed him by name

 captain mc bane he said  its against the law for you to ride in the niggercar

 who are you talkin to   returned the other  ill ride where i damn please

 yes sir but the colored passenger objects im afraid ill have to ask you to go into the smokingcar

 the hell you say   rejoined mc bane  ill leave this car when i get good and ready and that wont be till ive finished this cigar see  

he was as good as his word the conductor escaped from the car before miller had time for further expostulation finally mc bane having thrown the stump of his cigar into the aisle and added to the floor a finishing touch in the way of expectoration rose and went back into the white car

left alone in his questionable glory miller buried himself again in his newspaper from which he did not look up until the engine stopped at a tank station to take water

as the train came to a standstill a huge negro covered thickly with dust crawled off one of the rear tracks unobserved and ran round the rear end of the car to a wateringtrough by a neighboring well moved either by extreme thirst or by the fear that his time might be too short to permit him to draw a bucket of water he threw himself down by the trough drank long and deep and plunging his head into the water shook himself like a wet dog and crept furtively back to his dangerous perch

miller who had seen this man from the car window had noticed a very singular thing as the dusty tramp passed the rear coach he cast toward it a glance of intense ferocity up to that moment the mans face which miller had recognized under its grimy coating had been that of an ordinarily goodnatured somewhat reckless pleasureloving negro at present rather the worse for wear the change that now came over it suggested a concentrated hatred almost uncanny in its murderousness with awakened curiosity miller followed the direction of the negros glance and saw that it rested upon a window where captain mc bane sat looking out when miller looked back the negro had disappeared

at the next station a chinaman of the ordinary laundry type boarded the train and took his seat in the white car without objection at another point a colored nurse found a place with her mistress

 white people said miller to himself who had seen these passengers from the window  do not object to the negro as a servant as the traditional negro â the servant â he is welcomed  as an equal he is repudiated

miller was something of a philosopher he had long ago had the conclusion forced upon him that an educated man of his race in order to live comfortably in the united states must be either a philosopher or a fool  and since he wished to be happy and was not exactly a fool he had cultivated philosophy by and by he saw a white man with a dog enter the rear coach miller wondered whether the dog would be allowed to ride with his master and if not what disposition would be made of him he was a handsome dog and miller who was fond of animals would not have objected to the company of a dog as a dog he was nevertheless conscious of a queer sensation when he saw the porter take the dog by the collar and start in his own direction and felt consciously relieved when the canine passenger was taken on past him into the baggagecar ahead millers hand was hanging over the arm of his seat and the dog an intelligent shepherd licked it as he passed miller was not entirely sure that he would not have liked the porter to leave the dog there  he was a friendly dog and seemed inclined to be sociable

toward evening the train drew up at a station where quite a party of farm laborers fresh from their daily toil swarmed out from the conspicuously labeled colored waitingroom and into the car with miller they were a jolly goodnatured crowd and free from the embarrassing presence of white people proceeded to enjoy themselves after their own fashion here an amorous fellow sat with his arm around a buxom girls waist a musically inclined individual â his talents did not go far beyond inclination â produced a mouthorgan and struck up a tune to which a limberlegged boy danced in the aisle they were noisy loquacious happy dirty and malodorous for a while miller was amused and pleased they were his people and he felt a certain expansive warmth toward them in spite of their obvious shortcomings by and by however the air became too close and he went out upon the platform for the sake of the democratic ideal which meant so much to his race he might have endured the affliction he could easily imagine that people of refinement with the power in their hands might be tempted to strain the democratic ideal in order to avoid such contact but personally and apart from the mere matter of racial sympathy these people were just as offensive to him as to the whites in the other end of the train surely if a classification of passengers on trains was at all desirable it might be made upon some more logical and considerate basis than a mere arbitrary tactless and by the very nature of things brutal drawing of a color line it was a veritable bed of procrustes this standard which the whites had set for the negroes those who grew above it must have their heads cut off figuratively speaking â must be forced back to the level assigned to their race those who fell beneath the standard set had their necks stretched literally enough as the ghastly record in the daily papers gave conclusive evidence

miller breathed more freely when the lively crowd got off at the next station after a short ride moreover he had a light heart a conscience void of offense and was only thirty years old his philosophy had become somewhat jaded on this journey but he pulled it together for a final effort was it not after all a wise provision of nature that had given to a race destined to a long servitude and a slow emergence therefrom a cheerfulness of spirit which enabled them to catch pleasure on the wing and endure with equanimity the ills that seemed inevitable  the ability to live and thrive under adverse circumstances is the surest guaranty of the future the race which at the last shall inherit the earth â the residuary legatee of civilization â will be the race which remains longest upon it the negro was here before the anglosaxon was evolved and his thick lips and heavylidded eyes looked out from the inscrutable face of the sphinx across the sands of egypt while yet the ancestors of those who now oppress him were living in caves practicing human sacrifice and painting themselves with woad â and the negro is here yet

  blessed are the meek  quoted miller at the end of these consoling reflections for they shall inherit the earth if this be true the negro may yet come into his estate for meekness seems to be set apart as his portion

the journey came to an end just as the sun had sunk into the west

simultaneously with millers exit from the train a great black figure crawled off the trucks of the rear car on the side opposite the station platform stretching and shaking himself with a free gesture the black man seeing himself unobserved moved somewhat stiffly round the end of the car to the station platform

 fo de lawd   he muttered  ef i had n had a cham life id a never got here on dat ticket an dats a fac â it sho am  i kind er lowed i wuz gone a dozen times ez it wuz but i got my job ter do in dis worl an i knows i ain gwine ter die tel ive complished it i jes want one mo look at dat man an den ill haf ter git somethin ter eat fer two raw turnips in twelve hours is slim pickins fer a man er my size  

as the train drew up at the station platform dr price came forward from the white waitingroom and stood expectantly by the door of the white coach miller having left his car came down the platform in time to intercept burns as he left the train and to introduce him to dr price

 my carriage is in waiting said dr price  i should have liked to have you at my own house but my wife is out of town we have a good hotel however and you will doubtless find it more convenient  you are very kind dr price miller wont you come up and dine with me  

 thank you no said miller  i am expected at home my wife and child are waiting for me in the buggy yonder by the platform

 oh very well of course you must go but dont forget our appointment lets see dr price i can eat and get ready in half an hour â that will make it â  i have asked several of the local physicians to be present at eight oclock said dr price  the case can safely wait until then

very well miller be on hand at eight i shall expect you without fail where shall he come dr price

 to the residence of major philip carteret on vine street

 i have invited dr miller to be present and assist in the operation dr burns continued as they drove toward the hotel  he was a favorite pupil of mine and is a credit to the profession i presume you saw his article in the medical gazette  

yes and i assisted him in the case returned dr price  it was a colored lad one of his patients and he called me in to help him he is a capable man and very much liked by the white physicians

millers wife and child were waiting for him in fluttering anticipation he kissed them both as he climbed into the buggy

 we came at four oclock said mrs miller a handsome young woman who might be anywhere between twentyfive and thirty and whose complexion in the twilight was not distinguishable from that of a white person  but the train was late two hours they said we came back at six and have been waiting ever since

 yes papa piped the child a little boy of six or seven who sat between them and i am very hungry miller felt very much elated as he drove homeward through the twilight by his side sat the two persons whom he loved best in all the world his affairs were prosperous upon opening his office in the city he had been received by the members of his own profession with a cordiality generally frank and in no case much reserved the colored population of the city was large but in the main poor and the white physicians were not unwilling to share this unprofitable practice with a colored doctor worthy of confidence in the intervals of the work upon his hospital he had built up a considerable practice among his own people but except in the case of some poor unfortunate whose pride had been lost in poverty or sin no white patient had ever called upon him for treatment he knew very well the measure of his powers â a liberal education had given him opportunity to compare himself with other men â and was secretly conscious that in point of skill and knowledge he did not suffer by comparison with any other physician in the town he liked to believe that the race antagonism which hampered his progress and that of his people was a mere temporary thing the outcome of former conditions and bound to disappear in time and that when a colored man should demonstrate to the community in which he lived that he possessed character and power that community would find a way in which to enlist his services for the public good

he had already made himself useful and had received many kind words and other marks of appreciation he was now offered a further confirmation of his theory having recognized his skill the white people were now ready to take advantage of it any lurking doubt he may have felt when first invited by dr burns to participate in the operation had been dispelled by dr prices prompt acquiescence

on the way homeward miller told his wife of this appointment she was greatly interested  she was herself a mother with an only child moreover there was a stronger impulse than mere humanity to draw her toward the stricken mother janet had a tender heart and could have loved this white sister her sole living relative of whom she knew all her life long she had yearned for a kind word a nod a smile the least thing that imagination might have twisted into a recognition of the tie between them but it had never come

and yet janet was not angry she was of a forgiving temper  she could never bear malice she was educated had read many books and appreciated to the full the social forces arrayed against any such recognition as she had dreamed of of the two barriers between them a man might have forgiven the one  a woman would not be likely to overlook either the bar sinister or the difference of race even to the slight extent of a silent recognition blood is thicker than water but if it flow too far from conventional channels may turn to gall and wormwood nevertheless when the heart speaks reason falls into the background and janet would have worshiped this sister even afar off had she received even the slightest encouragement so strong was this weakness that she had been angry with herself for her lack of pride or even of a decent selfrespect it was she sometimes thought the heritage of her mothers race and she was ashamed of it as part of the taint of slavery she had never acknowledged even to her husband from whom she concealed nothing else her secret thoughts upon this lifelong sorrow this silent grief was natures penalty or societys revenge for whatever heritage of beauty or intellect or personal charm had come to her with her fathers blood for she had received no other inheritance her sister was rich by right of her birth if janet had been fortunate her good fortune had not been due to any provision made for her by her white father

she knew quite well how passionately for many years her proud sister had longed and prayed in vain for the child which had at length brought joy into her household and she could feel by sympathy all the sickening suspense with which the childs parents must await the result of this dangerous operation

 o will she adjured her husband anxiously when he had told her of the engagement you must be very careful think of the childs poor mother think of our own dear child and what it would mean to lose him 

dr price was not entirely at ease in his mind as the two doctors drove rapidly from the hotel to major carterets himself a liberal man from his point of view he saw no reason why a colored doctor might not operate upon a white male child â there are fine distinctions in the application of the color line â but several other physicians had been invited some of whom were men of oldfashioned notions who might not relish such an innovation

this however was but a small difficulty compared with what might be feared from major carteret himself for he knew carterets unrelenting hostility to anything that savored of recognition of the negro as the equal of white men it was traditional in wellington that no colored person had ever entered the front door of the carteret residence and that the luckless individual who once presented himself there upon alleged business and resented being ordered to the back door had been unceremoniously thrown over the piazza railing into a rather thorny clump of rosebushes below if miller were going as a servant to hold a basin or a sponge there would be no difficulty  but as a surgeon âwell he wouldnt borrow trouble under the circumstances the major might yield a point

but as they neared the house the majors unyielding disposition loomed up formidably perhaps if the matter were properly presented to dr burns he might consent to withdraw the invitation it was not yet too late to send miller a note

 by the way dr burns he said  i m very friendly to dr miller and should personally like to have him with us tonight butâi ought to have told you this before but i couldnt very well do so on such short notice in millers presence â we are a conservative people and our local customs are not very flexible we jog along in much the same old way our fathers did im not at all sure that major carteret or the other gentlemen would consent to the presence of a negro doctor

i think you misjudge your own people returned dr burns  they are broader than you think we have our prejudices against the negro at the north but we do not let them stand in the way of anything that we want at any rate it is too late now and i will accept the responsibility if the question is raised i will attend to it when i am performing an operation i must be aut caesar aut nullus

dr price was not reassured but he had done his duty and felt the reward of virtue if there should be trouble he would not be responsible moreover there was a large fee at stake and dr burns was not likely to prove too obdurate

they were soon at carterets where they found assembled the several physicians invited by dr price these were successively introduced as drs dudley hooper and ashe all of whom were gentlemen of good standing socially and in their profession and considered it a high privilege to witness so delicate an operation at the hands of so eminent a member of their profession

major carteret entered the room and was duly presented to the famous specialist carterets anxious look lightened somewhat at sight of the array of talent present it suggested of course the gravity of the impending event but gave assurance of all the skill and care which science could afford

dr burns was shown to the nursery from which he returned in five minutes

 the case is ready he announced  are the gentlemen all present  

 i believe so answered dr price quickly

miller had not yet arrived perhaps thought dr price a happy accident or some imperative call had detained him this would be fortunate indeed dr burnss square jaw had a very determined look it would be a pity if any acrimonious discussion should arise on the eve of a delicate operation if the clock on the mantel would only move faster the question might never come up

 i dont see dr miller observed dr burns looking around the room  i asked him to come at eight there are ten minutes yet

major carteret looked up with a sudden frown

 may i ask to whom you refer   he inquired in an ominous tone

the other gentlemen showed signs of interest not to say emotion dr price smiled quizzically

 dr miller of your city he was one of my favorite pupils he is also a graduate of the vienna hospitals and a surgeon of unusual skill i have asked him to assist in the operation

every eye was turned toward carteret whose crimsoned face had set in a look of grim determination

 the person to whom you refer is a negro i believe   he said

 he is a colored man certainly returned dr burns though one would never think of his color after knowing him well

 i do not know sir returned carteret with an effort at selfcontrol  what the customs of philadelphia or vienna may be but in the south we do not call negro doctors to attend white patients i could not permit a negro to enter my house upon such an errand

 i am here sir replied dr burns with spirit  to perform a certain operation since i assume the responsibility the case must be under my entire control otherwise i cannot operate

 gentlemen interposed dr price smoothly  i beg of you both â this is a matter for calm discussion and any asperity is to be deplored the life at stake here should not be imperiled by any consideration of minor importance

 your humanitydoes you credit sir retorted dr burns  but other matters too are important i have invited this gentleman here my professional honor is involved and i merely invoke my rights to maintain it it is a matter of principle which ought not to give way to a mere prejudice

 that also states the case for major carteret rejoined dr price suavely he has certain principles â call them prejudices if you like â certain inflexible rules of conduct by which he regulates his life one of these which he shares with us all in some degree forbids the recognition of the negro as a social equal

 i do not know what millers social value may be replied dr burns stoutly  or whether you gain or lose by your attitude toward him i have invited him here in a strictly professional capacity with which his color is not at all concerned

 dr burns does not quite appreciate major carterets point of view said dr price this is not with him an unimportant matter or a mere question of prejudice or even of personal taste it is a sacred principle lying at the very root of our social order involving the purity and prestige of our race you northern gentlemen do not quite appreciate our situation  if you lived here a year or two you would act as we do of course he added diplomatically  if there were no alternative â if dr burns were willing to put dr millers presence on the ground of imperative necessity  â  i do nothing of the kind sir retorted dr burns with some heat  i have not come all the way from philadelphia to undertake an operation which i cannot perform without the aid of some particular physician i merely stand upon my professional rights

carteret was deeply agitated the operation must not be deferred his childs life might be endangered by delay if the negros presence were indispensable he would even submit to it though in order to avoid so painful a necessity he would rather humble himself to the northern doctor the latter course involved merely a personal sacrifice â the former a vital principle perhaps there was another way of escape millers presence could not but be distasteful to mrs carteret for other reasons millers wife was the living evidence of a painful episode in mrs carterets family which the doctors presence would inevitably recall once before mrs carterets life had been endangered by encountering at a time of great nervous strain this illborn sister and her child she was even now upon the verge of collapse at the prospect of her childs suffering and should be protected from the intrusion of any idea which might add to her distress

 dr burns he said with the suave courtesy which was part of his inheritance  i beg your pardon for my heat and throw myself upon your magnanimity as between white men  â  i am a gentleman sir before i am a white man interposed dr burns slightly mollified however by carterets change of manner

 the terms should be synonymous carteret could not refrain from saying  as between white men and gentlemen i say to you frankly that there are vital personal reasons apart from dr millers color why his presence in this house would be distasteful with this statement sir i throw myself upon your mercy my childs life is worth more to me than any earthly thing and i must be governed by your decision

dr burns was plainly wavering the clock moved with provoking slowness miller would be there in five minutes

may i speak with you privately a moment doctor asked dr price

they withdrew from the room and were engaged in conversation for a few moments dr burns finally yielded

 i shall nevertheless feel humiliated when i meet miller again he said  but of course if there is a personal question involved that alters the situation had it been merely a matter of color i should have maintained my position as things stand i wash my hands of the whole affair so far as miller is concerned like pontius pilate âyes indeed sir i feel very much like that individual

 ill explain the matter to miller returned dr price amiably  and make it all right with him we southern people understand the negroes better than you do sir why should we not  they have been constantly under our interested observation for several hundred years you feel this vastly more than miller will he knows the feeling of the white people and is accustomed to it he wishes to live and do business here and is quite too shrewd to antagonize his neighbors or come where he is not wanted he is in fact too much of a gentleman to do so

 i shall leave the explanation to you entirely rejoined dr burns as they reentered the other room

carteret led the way to the nursery where the operation was to take place dr price lingered for a moment miller was not likely to be behind the hour if he came at all and it would be well to head him off before the operation began

scarcely had the rest left the room when the doorbell sounded and a servant announced dr miller

dr price stepped into the hall and met miller face to face

he had meant to state the situation to miller frankly but now that the moment had come he wavered he was a fine physician but he shrank from strenuous responsibilities it had been easy to theorize about the negro it was more difficult to look this man in the eyes â whom at this moment he felt to be as essentially a gentleman as himself â and tell him the humiliating truth

as a physician his method was to ease pain â he would rather take the risk of losing a patient from the use of an anaesthetic than from the shock of an operation he liked miller wished him well and would not wittingly wound his feelings he really thought him too much of a gentleman for the town in view of the restrictions with which he must inevitably be hampered there was something melancholy to a cultivated mind about a sensitive educated man who happened to be off color such a person was a sort of social misfit an odd quantity educated out of his own class with no possible hope of entrance into that above it he felt quite sure that if he had been in millers place he would never have settled in the south â he would have moved to europe or to the west indies or some central or south american state where questions of color were not regarded as vitally important

dr price did not like to lie even to a negro to a man of his own caste his word was his bond if it were painful to lie it would be humiliating to be found out the principle of noblesse oblige was also involved in the matter his claim of superiority to the colored doctor rested fundamentally upon the fact that he was white and miller was not and yet this superiority for which he could claim no credit since he had not made himself was the very breath of his nostrils â he would not have changed places with the other for wealth untold  and as a gentleman he would not care to have another gentleman even a colored man catch him in a lie of this however there was scarcely any danger a word to the other surgeons would insure their corroboration of whatever he might tell miller no one of them would willingly wound dr miller or embarrass dr price indeed they need not know that miller had come in time for the operation

 im sorry miller he said with apparent regret  but we were here ahead of time and the case took a turn which would admit of no delay so the gentlemen went in dr burns is with the patient now and asked me to explain why we did not wait for you

 im sorry too returned miller regretfully but nothing doubting he was well aware that in such cases danger might attend upon delay he had lost his chance through no fault of his own or of any one else

 i hope that all is well   he said hesitatingly not sure whether he would be asked to remain

 all is well so far step round to my office in the morning miller or come in when youre passing and ill tell you the details

this was tantamount to a dismissal so miller took his leave descending the doorsteps he stood for a moment undecided whether to return home or to go to the hotel and await the return of dr burns when he heard his name called from the house in a low tone

 oh doctuh  

he stepped back toward the door outside of which stood the colored servant who had just let him out

 dats all a lie doctuh he whispered  bout de operation bein already pefomed dey all had jes gone in de minute befo you come â doctuh price had n even got out n de room dey ben quollin bout you fer de las haf hour majah cateet say he would n have you an de notlien doctuh say he wouldnt do nothin widout you an doctuh price he jined in on bofe sides an dey had it hot an heavy nip an tuck till bimeby majah cateet up an say it want altogether yo color he objected to an wid dat de nothen doctuh give in hes a fine man suh but dey wuz too much fer im 

 thank you sam im much obliged returned miller mechanically  one likes to know the truth truth it has been said is mighty and must prevail but it sometimes leaves a bad taste in the mouth in the ordinary course of events miller would not have anticipated such an invitation and for that reason had appreciated it all the more the rebuff came with a corresponding shock he had the heart of a man the sensibilities of a cultivated gentleman  the one was sore the other deeply wounded he was not altogether sure upon reflection whether he blamed dr price very much for the amiable lie which had been meant to spare his feelings or thanked sam a great deal for the unpalatable truth

janet met him at the door  how is the baby   she asked excitedly

 dr price says he is doing well

 what is the matter will and why are you back so soon  

he would have spared her the story but she was a woman and would have it he was wounded too and wanted sympathy of which janet was an exhaustless fountain so he told her what had happened she comforted him after the manner of a loving woman and felt righteously indignant toward her sisters husband who had thus been instrumental in the humiliation of her own her anger did not embrace her sister and yet she felt obscurely that their unacknowledged relationship had been the malignant force which had given her husband pain and defeated his honorable ambition

when dr price entered the nursery dr burns was leaning attentively over the operating table the implements needed for the operation were all in readinessâ the knives the basin the sponge the materials for dressing the wound â all the ghastly paraphernalia of vivisection

mrs carteret had been banished to another room where clara vainly attempted to soothe her old mammy jane still burdened by her fears fervently prayed the good lord to spare the life of the sweet little grandson of her dear old mistress

dr burns had placed his ear to the childs chest which had been bared for the incision dr price stood ready to administer the anaesthetic little dodie looked up with a faint expression of wonder as if dimly conscious of some unusual event the major shivered at the thought of what the child must undergo

 theres a change in his breathing said dr burns lifting his head  the whistling noise is less pronounced and he breathes easier the obstruction seems to have shifted

applying his ear again to the childs throat he listened for a moment intently and then picking the baby up from the table gave it a couple of sharp claps between the shoulders simultaneously a small object shot out from the childs mouth struck dr price in the neighborhood of his waistband and then rattled lightly against the floor whereupon the baby as though conscious of his narrow escape smiled and gurgled and reaching upward clutched the doctors whiskers with his little hand which according to old jane had a stronger grip than any other infants in wellington

the campaign for white supremacy was dragging carteret had set out in the columns of the morning chronicle all the reasons why this movement inaugurated by the three men who had met six months before at the office of the chronicle should be supported by the white public negro citizenship was a grotesque farce â sambo and dinah raised from the kitchen to the cabinet were a spectacle to make the gods laugh the laws by which it had been sought to put the negroes on a level with the whites must be swept away in theory as they had failed in fact if it were impossible without a further education of public opinion to secure the repeal of the fifteenth amendment it was at least the solemn duty of the state to endeavor through its own constitution to escape from the domination of a weak and incompetent electorate and confine the negro to that inferior condition for which nature had evidently designed him

in spite of the force and intelligence with which carteret had expressed these and similar views they had not met the immediate response anticipated there were thoughtful men willing to let well enough alone who saw no necessity for such a movement they believed that peace prosperity and popular education offered a surer remedy for social ills than the reopening of issues supposed to have been settled

there were timid men who shrank from civic strife there were busy men who had something else to do there were a few fair men prepared to admit privately that a class constituting half to two thirds of the population were fairly entitled to some representation in the lawmaking bodies perhaps there might have been found somewhere in the state a single white man ready to concede that all men were entitled to equal rights before the law

that there were some white men who had learned little and forgotten nothing goes without saying for knowledge and wisdom are not impartially distributed among even the most favored race there were ignorant and vicious negroes and they had a monopoly of neither ignorance nor crime for there were prosperous negroes and povertystricken whites until carteret and his committee began their baleful campaign the people of the state were living in peace and harmony the antinegro legislation in more southern states with large negro majorities had awakened scarcely an echo in this state with a population two thirds white even the triumph of the fusion party had not been regarded as a race issue it remained for carteret and his friends to discover with inspiration from whatever supernatural source the discriminating reader may elect that the darker race docile by instinct humble by training patiently waiting upon its as yet uncertain destiny was an incubus a corpse chained to the body politic and that the negro vote was a source of danger to the state no matter how cast or by whom directed

to discuss means for counteracting this apathy a meeting of the  big three as they had begun to designate themselves jocularly was held at the office of the  morning chronicle on the next day but one after little dodies fortunate escape from the knife

 it seems said general belmont opening the discussion  as though we had undertaken more than we can carry through it is clear that we must reckon on opposition both at home and abroad if we are to hope for success we must extend the lines of our campaign the north as well as our own people must be convinced that we have right upon our side we are conscious of the purity of our motives but we should avoid even the appearance of evil

mc bane was tapping the floor impatiently with his foot during this harangue

 i dont see the use he interrupted  of so much beating about the bush we may as well be honest about this thing we are going to put the niggers down because we want to and think we can  so why waste our time in mere pretense  im no hypocrite myself â if i want a thing i take it provided im strong enough

 my dear captain resumed the general with biting suavity  your frankness does you credit â  an honest man s the noblest work of god â but we cannot carry on politics in these degenerate times without a certain amount of diplomacy in the good old days when your father was alive and perhaps nowadays in the discipline of convicts direct and simple methods might be safely resorted to  but this is a modern age and in dealing with so fundamental a right as the suffrage we must profess a decent regard for the opinions of even that misguided portion of mankind which may not agree with us this is the age of crowds and we must have the crowd with us

the captain flushed at the allusion to his fathers calling at which he took more offense than at the mention of his own he knew perfectly well that these old aristocrats while reaping the profits of slavery had despised the instruments by which they were attained â the poorwhite overseer only less than the black slave mc bane was rich  he lived in wellington but he had never been invited to the home of either general belmont or major carteret nor asked to join the club of which they were members his face therefore wore a distinct scowl and his single eye glowed ominously he would help these fellows carry the state for white supremacy and then he would have his innings â he would have more to say than they dreamed as to who should fill the offices under the new deal men of no better birth or breeding than he had represented southern states in congress since the war why should he not run for governor representative whatever he chose  he had money enough to buy out half a dozen of these brokendown aristocrats and money was allpowerful

you see captain the general went on looking mc bane smilingly and unflinchingly in the eye  we need white immigration â we need northern capital a good name is better than great riches and we must prove our cause a righteous one

we must be armed at all points added carteret  and prepared for defense as well as for attack â we must make our campaign a national one

 for instance resumed the general  you carteret represent the associated press through your hands passes all the news of the state what more powerful medium for the propagation of an idea

the man who would govern a nation by writing its songs was a blethering idiot beside the fellow who can edit its news dispatches the negroes are playing into our hands â every crime that one of them commits is reported by us with the latitude they have had in this state they are growing more impudent and selfassertive every day a yellow demagogue in new york made a speech only a few days ago in which he deliberately and in cold blood advised negroes to defend themselves to the death when attacked by white people i remember well the time when it was death for a negro to strike a white man

 its death now if he strikes the right one interjected mc bane restored to better humor by this mention of a congenial subject

the general smiled a fine smile he had heard the story of how mc bane had lost his other eye

 the local negro paper is quite outspoken too continued the general if not impudent we must keep track of that it may furnish us some good campaign material

 yes returned carteret  we must see to that i threw a copy into the wastebasket this morning without looking at it here it is now 

carteret fished from the depths of the wastebasket and handed to the general an eighteen by twentyfour sheet poorly printed on cheap paper with a  patent  inside a number of advertisements of proprietary medicines quack doctors and fortunetellers and two or three columns of editorial and local news candor compels the admission that it was not an impressive sheet in any respect except when regarded as the first local effort of a struggling people to make public expression of their life and aspirations from this point of view it did not speak at all badly for a class to whom a generation before newspapers books and learning had been forbidden fruit

 its an elegant specimen of journalism isnt it   laughed the general airily  listen to this  ad  â kinky curly hair made straight by one application of our specific our face bleach will turn the skin of a black or brown person four or five shades lighter and of a mulatto perfectly white when you get the color you wish stop using the preparation  just look at those heads  â  before using  and after using wed better hurry or therell be no negroes to disfranchise if they dont stop till they get the color they desire and the stuff works according to contract theyll all be white ah what have we here  this looks as though it might be serious

opening the sheet the general read aloud an editorial article to which carteret listened intently his indignation increasing in strength from the first word to the last while mc banes face grew darkly purple with anger

the article was a frank and somewhat bold discussion of lynching and its causes it denied that most lynchings were for the offense most generally charged as their justification and declared that even of those seemingly traced to this cause many were not for crimes at all but for voluntary acts which might naturally be expected to follow from the miscegenation laws by which it was sought in all the southern states to destroy liberty of contract and for the purpose of maintaining a fanciful purity of race to make crimes of marriages to which neither nature nor religion nor the laws of other states interposed any insurmountable barrier such an article in a northern newspaper would have attracted no special attention and might merely have furnished food to an occasional reader for serious thought upon a subject not exactly agreeable but coming from a colored man in a southern city it was an indictment of the laws and social system of the south that could not fail of creating a profound sensation

 infamous â infamous   exclaimed carteret his voice trembling with emotion  the paper should be suppressed immediately

 the impudent nigger ought to be horsewhipped and run out of town growled mc bane

 gentlemen said the general soothingly after the first burst of indignation had subsided  i believe we can find a more effective use for this article which by the way will not bear too close analysis â theres some truth in it at least theres an argument

 that is not the point interrupted carteret

 no interjected mc bane with an oath  that aint at all the point truth or not no damn nigger has any right to say it

 this article said carteret  violates an unwritten law of the south if we are to tolerate this race of weaklings among us until they are eliminated by the stress of competition it must be upon terms which we lay down one of our conditions is violated by this article in which our wisdom is assailed and our women made the subject of offensive comment we must make known our disapproval

 i say lynch the nigger break up the press and burn down the newspaper office mc bane responded promptly

 gentlemen interposed the general  would you mind suspending the discussion for a moment while i send jerry across the street  i think i can then suggest a better plan

carteret rang the bell for jerry who answered promptly he had been expecting such a call ever since the gentlemen had gone in

jerry said the general  step across to browns and tell him to send me three calhoun cocktails wait for them â heres the money

yas sub replied jerry taking the proffered coin

 and make hase charcoal added mc bane  for were gettin damn dry

a momentary cloud of annoyance darkened carterets brow mc bane had always grated upon his aristocratic susceptibilities the captain was an upstart a product of the democratic idea operating upon the poor white man the descendant of the indentured bondservant and the socially unfit he had wealth and energy however and it was necessary to make use of him  but the example of such men was a strong incentive to carteret in his campaign against the negro it was distasteful enough to rub elbows with an illiterate and vulgar white man of no ancestryâ the risk of similar contact with negroes was to be avoided at any cost he could hardly expect mc bane to be a gentleman but when among men of that class he might at least try to imitate their manners a gentleman did not order his own servants around â offensively to say nothing of anothers

the general had observed carterets annoyance and remarked pleasantly while they waited for the servants return  â  jerry now is a very good negro hes not one of your new negroes who think themselves as good as white men and want to run the government jerry knows his place â he is respectful humble obedient and content with the face and place assigned to him by nature

yes hes one of the best of em sneered mc bane  hell call any man  master  for a quarter or  god  for half a dollar for a dollar youll grovel at your feet and for a castoff coat you can buy an option on his immortal soul â if he has one  ive handled niggers for ten years and i know em from the ground up theyre all alike â theyre a scrub race an affliction to the country and the quicker were rid of em all the better

carteret had nothing to say by way of dissent mcbanes sentiments in their last analysis were much the same as his though he would have expressed them less brutally

 the negro observed the general daintily flicking the ash from his cigar  is all right in his place and very useful to the community we lived on his labor for quite a long time and lived very well nevertheless we are better off without slavery for we can get more out of the free negro and with less responsibility i really do not see how we could get along without the negroes if they were all like jerry we vi have no trouble with them

having procured the drinks jerry the momentary subject of the race discussion which goes on eternally in the south was making his way back across the street somewhat disturbed in mind

 o lawd  he groaned  i never troubles trouble till trouble troubles me  but wen i got dem drinks befo ginl belmont gimme half a dollar an tol me ter keep de change dis time he did n say nothin bout de change i spose he jes fergot erbout it but wat is a po nigger gwine ter do wen he has ter con ten wid wite folkss fergitfulniss i don see no way but ter do some fergittin mysef ill jes stan outside de do here till dey gits so wrop up in deir talk dat dey won member nothin ese an den at de right minute ill han de glasses roun an mos lackly de ginlll fergit all bout de change

while jerry stood outside the conversation within was plainly audible and some inkling of its purport altered through his mind

 now gentlemen the general was saying heres my plan that editorial in the negro newspaper is good campaign matter but we should reserve it until it will be most effective suppose we just stick it in a pigeonhole and let the editor â whats his name

the niggers name is barber replied mc bane  id like to have him under me for a month or two  hed write no more editorials

 let barber have all the rope he wants resumed the general  and youll be sure to hang himself in the mean time we will continue to work up public opinion â we can use this letter privately for that purpose â and when the state campaign opens well print the editorial with suitable comment scatter it broadcast throughout the state fire the southern heart organize the white people on the color line have a little demonstration with red shirts and shotguns scare the negroes into fits win the state for white supremacy and teach our colored fellow citizens that we are tired of negro domination and have put an end to it forever the afroamerican banner will doubtless die about the same time

 and so will the editor  exclaimed mc bane ferociously  ill see to that but i wonder where that nigger is with them cocktails  im so thirsty i could swallow blue blazes

 heres yo drinks ginl announced jerry entering with the glasses on a tray

the gentlemen exchanged compliments and imbibed â mc bane at a gulp carteret with more deliberation leaving about half the contents of his glass

the general drank slowly with every sign of appreciation  if the illustrious statesman he observed  whose name this mixture bears had done nothing more than invent it his fame would still deserve to go thundering down the endless ages

 it aint bad liquor assented mc bane smacking his lips

jerry received the empty glasses on the tray and left the room he had scarcely gained the hall when the general called him back

 o lawd   groaned jerry  hes gwine ter ax me fer de change yas suh yas suh comin ginl comin suh 

 you may keep the change jerry said the general

jerrys face grew radiant at this announcement  yas suh ginl thank y suh much obleedzed suh i wuz jus gwine ter fetch it in suh wen i had put de tray down thank y suh truly suh  

jerry backed and bowed himself out into the hall

 dat wuz a close shave he muttered as he swallowed the remaining contents of major carterets glass  i lowed dem twenty cents wuz gone dat time â an whar i wuz gwine ter git de money ter take my gal ter de chuch festibal ternight de lawd only knows â lessn i borried it oflln mr ellis an i owes him sixty cents aready but i wonduh wat dem wite folks in dere is up ter  deres one thing sho â deyre gwine ter git after de niggers some way er nuther an wen dey does whar is jerry gwine ter be  dats de mos impotantes question im gwine ter look at dat newspaper dey ben talkin bout an lessn my min changes mightly im gwine ter keep my mouf shet an stan in wid de angrysaxon race â ez dey calls deyseves nowadays â an keep on de right side er my bread an meat wat nigger ever give me twenty cents in all my bawn days  

 by the way major said the general who lingered behind mc bane as they wrere leaving  is miss claras marriage definitely settled upon  

 well general not exactly but its the understanding that they will marry when they are old enough

i was merely thinking the general went on  that if i were you id speak to tom about cards and liquor he gives more time to both than a young man can afford im speaking in his interest and in miss claras â we of the old families ought to stand together

 thank you general for the hint ill act upon it

this political conference was fruitful in results acting upon the plans there laid out mc bane traveled extensively through the state working up sentiment in favor of the new movement he possessed a certain forceful eloquence  and white supremacy was so obviously the divine intention that he had merely to affirm the doctrine in order to secure adherents

general belmont whose business required him to spend much of the winter in washington and new york lost no opportunity to get the ear of lawmakers editors and other leaders of national opinion and to impress upon them with persuasive eloquence the impossibility of maintaining existing conditions and the tremendous blunder which had been made in conferring the franchise upon the emancipated race

carteret conducted the press campaign and held out to the republicans of the north the glittering hope that with the elimination of the negro vote and a proper deference to southern feeling a strong white republican party might be built up in the new south how well the bait took is a matter of history â but the promised result is still in the future the disfranchisement of the negro has merely changed the form of the same old problem the negro had no vote before the rebellion and few other rights and yet the negro question was for a century the pivot of american politics it plunged the nation into a bloody war and it will trouble the american government and the american conscience until a sustained attempt is made to settle it upon principles of justice and equity

the personal ambitions entertained by the leaders of this movement are but slightly involved in this story mc banes aims have been touched upon elsewhere the general would have accepted the nomination for governor of the state with a vision of a senatorship in the future carteret hoped to vindicate the supremacy of his race and make the state fit for his son to live in and incidentally he would not refuse any office worthy of his dignity which a grateful people might thrust upon him

so powerful a combination of bigot selfseeking demagogue and astute politician was fraught with grave menace to the peace of the state and the liberties of the people â by which is meant the whole people and not any one class sought to be built up at the expense of another

carteret did not forget what general belmont had said in regard to tom the major himself had been young not so very long ago and was inclined toward indulgence for the foibles of youth a young gentleman should have a certain knowledge of life â but there were limits claras future happiness must not be imperiled

the opportunity to carry out this purpose was not long delayed old mr delamere wished to sell some timber which had been cut at belleview and sent tom down to the chronicle office to leave an advertisement the major saw him at the desk invited him into his sanctum and delivered him a mild lecture the major was kind and talked in a fatherly way about the danger of extremes the beauty of moderation and the value of discretion as a rule of conduct he mentioned collaterally the unblemished honor of a fine old family its contemplated alliance with his own and dwelt upon the sweet simplicity of claras character the major was a man of feeling and of tact and could not have put the subject in a way less calculated to wound the amour propre of a very young man

delamere had turned red with anger while the major was speaking he was impulsive and an effort was required to keep back the retort that sprang once or twice to his lips but his conscience was not clear and he could not afford hard words with claras guardian and his grandfathers friend clara was rich and the most beautiful girl in town  they were engaged  he loved her as well as he could love anything of which he seemed sure  and he did not mean that any one else should have her the majors mild censure disturbed slightly his sense of security and while the majors manner did not indicate that he knew anything definite against him it would be best to let well enough alone

 thank you major he said with wellsimulated frankness  i realize that i may have been a little careless more from thoughtlessness than anything else  but my heart is all right sir and i am glad that my conduct has been brought to your attention for what you have said enables me to see it in a different light i will be more careful of my company hereafter for i love clara and mean to try to be worthy of her do you know whether she will be at home this evening

 i have heard nothing to the contrary replied the major warmly  call her up by telephone and ask â or come up and see youre always welcome my boy

upon leaving the office which was on the second floor tom met ellis coming up the stairs it had several times of late occuried to tom that ellis had a sneaking fondness for clara panoplied in his own engagement tom had heretofore rather enjoyed the idea of a hopeless rival ellis was such a solemn prig and took life so seriously that it was a pleasure to see him sit around sighing for the unattainable that he should be giving pain to ellis added a certain zest to his own enjoyment

but this interview with the major had so disquieted him that upon meeting ellis upon the stairs he was struck by a sudden suspicion he knew that major carteret seldom went to the clarendon club and that he must have got his information from some one else ellis was a member of the club and a frequent visitor who more likely than he to try to poison claras mind or the minds of her friends against her accepted lover  tom did not think that the world was using him well of late  bad luck had pursued him in cards and other things and despite his assumption of humility carterets lecture had left him in an ugly mood he nodded curtly to ellis without relaxing the scowl that disfigured his handsome features

 thats the damned sneak whos been giving me away he muttered  ill get even with him yet for this

delameres suspicions with regard to elliss feelings were not as we have seen entirely without foundation indeed he had underestimated the strength of this rivalry and its chances of success ellis had been watching delamere for a year there had been nothing surreptitious about it but his interest in clara had led him to note things about his favored rival which might have escaped the attention of others less concerned

ellis was an excellent judge of character and had formed a very decided opinion of tom delamere to ellis unbiased by ancestral traditions biased perhaps by jealousy tom delamere was a type of the degenerate aristocrat if as he had often heard it took three or four generations to make a gentleman and as many more to complete the curve and return to the base from which it started tom delamere belonged somewhere on the downward slant with large possibilities of further decline old mr delamere who might be taken as the apex of an ideal aristocratic development had been distinguished during his active life as ellis had learned for courage and strength of will courtliness of bearing deference to his superiors of whom there had been few courtesy to his equals kindness and consideration for those less highly favored and above all a scrupulous sense of honor  his grandson tom was merely the shadow without the substance the empty husk without the grain of grace he had plenty in manners he could be perfect when he so chose courage and strength he had none ellis had seen this fellow who boasted of his descent from a line of cavaliers turn pale with fright and spring from a buggy to which was harnessed a fractious horse which a negro stableboy drove fearlessly a valiant carpetknight skilled in all parlor exercises great at whist or euchre a dream of a dancer unexcelled in cakewalk or  coon  impersonations for which he was in large social demand ellis had seen him kick an inoffensive negro out of his path and treat a poorwhite man with scant courtesy he suspected delamere of cheating at cards and knew that others entertained the same suspicion for while regular in his own habits â his poverty would not have permitted him any considerable extravagance â elliss position as a newspaper man kept him in touch with what was goingon about town he was a member proposed by carteret of the clarendon club where cards were indulged in within reasonable limits and a certain set were known to bet dollars in terms of dimes

delamere was careless too about money matters he had a habit of borrowing right and left small sums which might be conveniently forgotten by the borrower and for which the lender would dislike to ask ellis had a strain of thrift derived from a scotch ancestry and a tenacious memory for financial details indeed he had never had so much money that he could lose track of it he never saw delamere without being distinctly conscious that delamere owed him four dollars which he had lent at a time when he could ill afford to spare it it was a prerogative of aristocracy ellis reflected to live upon others and the last privilege which aristocracy in decay would willingly relinquish neither did the aristocratic memory seem able to retain the sordid details of a small pecuniary transaction

no doubt the knowledge that delamere was the favored lover of miss pemberton lent a touch of bitterness to elliss reflections upon his rival ellis had no grievance against the aristocracy of wellington the  best people  had received him cordially though his father had not been of their caste but ellis hated a hypocrite and despised a coward and he felt sure that delamere was both otherwise he would have struggled against his love for clara pemberton his passion for her had grown with his appreciation of delameres unworthiness as a friend of the family he knew the nature and terms of the engagement and that if the marriage took place at all it would not be for at least a year this was a long time â many things might happen in a year especially to a man like tom delamere if for any reason delamere lost his chance ellis meant to be next in the field he had not made love to clara but he had missed no opportunity of meeting her and making himself quietly and unobtrusively agreeable

on the day after this encounter with delamere on the stairs of the chronicle office ellis while walking down vine street met old mrs ochiltree she was seated in her own buggy which was of ancient build and pattern driven by her colored coachman and man of all work

 mr ellis she called in a shrill voice having directed her coachman to draw up at the curb as she saw the young man approaching  come here i want to speak to you

ellis came up to the buggy and stood uncovered beside it

 people are saying said mrs ochiltree  that tom delamere is drinking hard and has to be carried home intoxicated two or three times a week by old mr delameres man sandy is there any truth in the story

 my dear mrs ochiltree i am not tom delameres keeper sandy could tell you better than i

 you are dodging my question mr ellis sandy wouldnt tell me the truth and i know that you wouldnt lie â you dont look like a liar they say tom is gambling scandalously what do you know about that  

you must excuse me mrs ochiltree a great deal of what we hear is mere idle gossip and the truth is often grossly exaggerated im a member of the same club with delamere and gentlemen who belong to the same club are not in the habit of talking about one another as long as a man retains his club membership hes presumed to be a gentleman i wouldnt say anything against delamere if i could

 you dont need to replied the old lady shaking her finger at him with a cunning smile  you are a very open young man mr ellis and i can read you like a book you are much smarter than you look but you cant fool me goodmorning

mrs ochiltree drove immediately to her nieces where she found mrs carteret and clara at home clara was very fond of the baby and was holding him in her arms he was a fine baby and bade fair to realize the bright hopes built upon him

you hold a baby very naturally clara chuckled the old lady  i suppose you are in training but you ought to talk to tom i have just learned from mr ellis that tom is carried home drunk two or three times a week and that he is gambling in the most reckless manner imaginable

claras eyes flashed indignantly ere she could speak mrs carteret exclaimed â  why aunt polly  did mr ellis say that

 i got it from dinah she replied  who heard it from her husband who learned it from a waiter at the club and  â pshaw said mrs carteret mere servants gossip

no it isnt olivia i met mr ellis on the street and asked him point blank and he didnt deny it hes a member of the club and ought to know

 well aunt polly it cant be true tom is here every other night and how could he carry on so without showing the signs of it and where would he get the money  you know he has only a moderate allowance

 he may win it at cards â its better to be bom lucky than rich returned mrs ochiltree  then he has expectations and can get credit theres no doubt that tom is going on shamefully

claras indignation had not yet found vent in speech  olivia had said all that was necessary but she had been thinking rapidly even if all this had been true why should mr ellis have said it  or if he had not stated it directly he had left the inference to be drawn it seemed a most unfair and ungentlemanly thing what motive could ellis have for such an act

she was not long in reaching a conclusion which was not flattering to ellis mr ellis came often to the house and she had enjoyed his society in a friendly way that he had found her pleasant company had been very evident she had never taken his attentions seriously however or regarded his visits as made especially to her nor had the rest of the family treated them from that point of view her engagement to tom delamere though not yet formally ratified was so well understood by the world of wellington that mr ellis would scarcely have presumed to think of her as anything more than a friend

this revelation of her aunts however put a different face upon his conduct certain looks and sighs and enigmatical remarks of ellis to which she had paid but casual attention and attached no particular significance now recurred to her memory with a new meaning he had now evidently tried in a roundabout way to besmirch toms character and undermine him in her regard while loving tom she had liked ellis well enough as a friend but he had abused the privileges of friendship and she would teach him a needed lesson

nevertheless mrs ochiltrees story had given clara food for thought she was uneasily conscious after all that there might be a grain of truth in what had been said enough at least to justify her in warning tom to be careful lest his enemies should distort some amiable weakness into a serious crime

she put this view of the case to tom at their next meeting assuring him at the same time of her unbounded faith and confidence she did not mention elliss name lest tom in righteous indignation might do something rash which he might thereafter regret if any subtler or more obscure motive kept her silent as to ellis she was not aware of it for claras views of life were still in the objective stage and she had not yet fathomed the deepest recesses of her own consciousness

delamere had the cunning of weakness he knew too better than any one else could know how much truth there was in the rumors concerning him and whether or not they could be verified too easily for him to make an indignant denial after a little rapid reflection he decided upon a different course

 clara he said with a sigh taking the hand which she generously yielded to soften any suggestion of reproach which he may have read into her solicitude  you are my guardian angel i do not know of course who has told you this pack of lies â for i can see that you have heard more than you have told me â but i think i could guess the man they came from i am not perfect clara though i have done nothing of which a gentleman should be ashamed there is one sure way to stop the tongue of calumny my home life is not ideal â grandfather is an old weak man and the house needs the refining and softening influence of a ladys presence i do not love club life its ideals are not elevating with you by my side dearest i should be preserved from every influence except the purest and the best dont you think dearest that the major might be induced to shorten our weary term of waiting  

 oh tom she demurred blushingly  i shall be young enough at eighteen  and you are barely twentyone

but tom proved an eloquent pleader and love a still more persuasive advocate clara spoke to the major the same evening who looked grave at the suggestion and said he would think about it they were both very young  but where both parties were of good family in good health and good circumstances an early marriage might not be undesirable tom was perhaps a little unsettled but blood would tell in the long run and marriage always exercised a steadying influence

the only return therefore which ellis received for his wellmeant effort to ward off mrs ochiltrees embarrassing inquiries was that he did not see clara upon his next visit which was made one afternoon while he was on night duty at the office in conversation with mrs carteret he learned that claras marriage had been definitely agreed upon and the date fixed â it was to take place in about six months meeting miss pemberton on the street the following day he received the slightest of nods when he called again at the house after a week of misery she treated him with a sarcastic coolness which chilled his heart

how have i offended you miss clara he demanded desperately when they were left alone for a moment

offended me she replied lifting her eyebrows with an air of puzzled surprise  why mr ellis

what could have put such a notion into your head  oh dear i think i hear dodie â i know youll excuse me mr ellis wont you  sister olivia will be back in a moment and were expecting aunt polly this afternoon â if youll stay awhile shell be glad to talk to you you can tell her all the interesting news about your friends 

when ellis after this rebuff had disconsolately taken his leave clara much elated at the righteous punishment she had inflicted upon the slanderer ran upstairs to the nursery and snatching dodie from mammy janes arms began dancing gayly with him round the room

 look ahyuh honey said mammy jane  you better be keerful wid dat chile an don drap im on de flo you might let him fall on his head an break his neck my my but you two does make a pretty pictur youll be wantin ole jane ter come an nuss yo childen some er dese days she chuckled unctuously

mammy jane had been very much disturbed by the recent dangers through which little dodie had passed and his escape from strangulation in the first place and then from the knife had impressed her as little less than miraculous she was not certain whether this result had been brought about by her manipulation of the buried charm or by the prayers which had been offered for the child but was inclined to believe that both had cooperated to avert the threatened calamity the favorable outcome of this particular incident had not however altered the general situation prayers and charms after all were merely temporary things which must be constantly renewed and might be forgotten or overlooked  while the mole on the contrary neither faded nor went away if its malign influence might for a time seem to disappear it was merely lying dormant like the germs of some deadly disease awaiting its opportunity to strike at an unguarded spot

clara and the baby were laughing in great glee when a mockingbird perched on the topmost bough of a small tree opposite the nursery window burst suddenly into song with many a trill and quaver clara with the child in her arms sprang to the open window

 sister olivia she cried turning her face toward mrs carteret who at that moment entered the room  come and look at dodie

the baby was listening intently to the music meanwhile gurgling with delight and reaching his chubby hands toward the source of this pleasing sound it seemed as though the mockingbird were aware of his appreciative audience for he ran through the songs of a dozen different birds selecting with the discrimination of a connoisseur and entire confidence in his own powers those which were most difficult and most alluring

mrs carteret approached the window followed by mammy jane who waddled over to join the admiring party so absorbed were the three women in the baby and the bird that neither one of them observed a neat top buggy drawn by a sleek sorrel pony passing slowly along the street before the house in the buggy was seated a lady and beside her a little boy dressed in a childs sailor suit and a straw hat the lady with a wistful expression was looking toward the party grouped in the open window

mrs carteret chancing to lower her eyes for an instant caught the other womans look directed toward her and her child with a glance of cold aversion she turned away from the window

old mammy jane had observed this movement and had divined the reason for it she stood beside clara watching the retreating buggy

 uhhuh   she said to herself  its huh sister janet she maied a doctuh an all dat an she lives in a big house an shes ben roun de worl an de lawd knows where ese but mis livy don like de sight er her an never will ez long ez de sun rises an sets dey cetnly does favor one anudder â anybody mought low dey wuz twins ef dey did n know better well well foty yeahs ago whod a ever expected ter see a nigger gal ridin in her own buggy  my my but i don know â i don know  it don look right an it ain gwine ter las â you cant make me blieve 

meantime janet stung by mrs carterets look â the nearest approach she had ever made to a recognition of her sisters existence â had turned away with hardening face she had struck her pony sharply with the whip much to the gentle creatures surprise when the little boy who was still looking back caught his mothers sleeve and exclaimed excitedly â  look look mamma the baby â the baby  janet turned instantly and with a mothers instinct gave an involuntary cry of alarm

at the moment when mrs carteret had turned away from the window and while mammy jane was watching janet clara had taken a step forward and was leaning against the windowsill the baby convulsed with delight had given a spasmodic spring and slipped from claras arms instinctively the young woman gripped the long skirt as it slipped through her hands and held it tenaciously though too frightened for an instant to do more mammy jane ashen with sudden dread uttered an inarticulate scream but retained selfpossession enough to reach down and draw up the child which hung dangerously suspended head downward over the brick pavement below

 oh clara clara how could you  exclaimed mrs carteret reproachfully  you might have killed my child

she had snatched the child from janes arms and was holding him closely to her own breast struck by a sudden thought she drew near the window and looked out twice within a few weeks her child had been in serious danger and upon each occasion a member of the miller family had been involved for she had heard of dr millers presumption in trying to force himself where he must have known he would be unwelcome

janet was just turning her head away as the buggy moved slowly off olivia felt a violent wave of antipathy sweep over her toward this baseborn sister who had thus thrust herself beneath her eyes if she had not cast her brazen glance toward the window she herself would not have turned away and lost sight of her child to this shameless intrusion linked with claras carelessness had been due the catastrophe so narrowly averted which might have darkened her own life forever she took to her bed for several days and for a long time was cold toward clara and did not permit her to touch the child

mammy jane entertained a theory of her own about the accident by which the blame was placed in another way exactly where mrs carteret had laid it julias daughter janet had been looking intently toward the window just before little dodie had sprung from claras arms might she not have cast the evil eye upon the baby and sought thereby to draw him out of the window  one would not ordinarily expect so young a woman to possess such a power but she might have acquired it for this very purpose from some more experienced person by the same reasoning the mockingbird might have been a familiar of the witch and the two might have conspired to lure the infant to destruction whether this were so or not the transaction at least wore a peculiar look there was no use telling mis livy about it for she didnt believe or pretended not to believe in witchcraft and conjuration but one could not be too careful the child was certainly born to be exposed to great dangers â the mole behind the left ear was an unfailing sign â and no precaution should be omitted to counteract its baleful influence

while adjusting the babys crib a few days later mrs carteret found fastened under one of the slats a small bag of cotton cloth about half an inch long and tied with a black thread upon opening which she found a few small roots or fibres and a pinch of dried and crumpled herbs it was a goodluck charm which mammy jane had placed there to ward off the threatened evil from the grandchild of her dear old mistress mrs carterets first impulse was to throw the bag into the fire but on second thoughts she let it remain to remove it would give unnecessary pain to the old nurse of course these old negro superstitions were absurd â but if the charm did no good it at least would do no harm

one morning shortly after the opening of the hospital while dr miller was making his early rounds a new patient walked in with a smile on his face and a broken arm hanging limply by his side miller recognized in him a black giant by the name of josh green who for many years had worked on the docks for millers fatherâand simultaneously identified him as the dustbegrimed negro who had stolen a ride to wellington on the trucks of a passenger car

 well josh asked the doctor as he examined the fracture how did you get this been fighting again  

 no suh i don spose you could hadly call it a fight one er dem dagoes off n a souf american boat gimme some er his jaw an i give im a back answer an here i is wid a broken arm he got holt er a belayinpin befo i could hit im

 what became of the other man   demanded miller suspiciously he perceived from the indifference with which josh bore the manipulation of the fractured limb that such an accident need not have interfered seriously with the use of the remaining arm and he knew that josh had a reputation for absolute fearlessness

 lemme see said josh reflectively  ef i kin member wat did become er him oh yes imenber now  dey tuck him ter de marine horspittle in de amberlanee cause his leg wuz broke an i reckon somethin must a accidently hit im in de jaw fer he wuz scattrin teeth all de way long de street i did n wan ter kill de man fer he might have somebody dependin on im an i knows how datd be ter dem but no man kin call me a damn lowdown nigger and keep on enjoyin good health right along

 it was considerate of you to spare his life said miller dryly  but youll hit the wrong man some day these are bad times for bad negroes youll get into a quarrel with a white man and at the end of it therell be a lynching or a funeral youd better be peaceable and endure a little injustice rather than run the risk of a sudden and violent death

 i expecs ter die a vilent death in a quarrel wrid a wite man replied josh in a matteroffact tone  an futhermo he s gwine ter die at the same time er a little befo i ben takin my own time bout killin im i ain ben crowdin de man but ill be ready after a wile an den he kin look out 

 and i suppose youre merely keeping in practice on these other fellows who come your way when i get your arm dressed youd better leave town till that fellows boat sails  it may save you the expense of a trial and three months in the chaingang but this talk about killing a man is all nonsense what has any man in this town done to you that you should thirst for his blood  

 no suh it ain nonsense â its straight solem fac im gwine ter kill dat man as sho as im settin in dis cheer  an dey ain nobody kin say i ain got a right ter kill im does you member de kuklux  

 yes but i was a child at the time and recollect very little about them it is a page of history which most people are glad to forget

 yas suh  i was a chile too but i wuz right in it an so i members mo erbout it n you does my mammy an daddy lived bout ten miles fm here up de river one night a crowd er wite men come ter ou house an tuck my daddy out an shot im ter death an skeered my mammy so she ain ben hersef fm dat day ter dis i want mo n ten years ole at de time an wen my mammy seed de wite men comin she tol me ter run i hid in de bushes an seen de whole thing an it wuz branded on my memry suh like a redhot iron brans de skin de wite folks had masks on but one of em fell off â he wuz de boss he wuz de head man an tol de res wat ter do â an i seen his face it wuz a easy face ter member an i swo den way down deep in my heat little ez i wuz dat some day er nother id kill dat man i aint never had no doubt erbout it its jus wat im livin fer an i know i ain gwine ter die till ive done it some lives fer one thing an some fer another but dats my job i ain ben in no hase fer im not ole yit an dat man is in good health id like ter see a little er de worl befo i takes chances on leavin it sudden  an moover somebodys got ter take keer er de ole oman but her timell come some er dese days an den his timell be come â an probly mine but i ain keerin bout mysef  wen i git thoo wid him it won make no diffence bout me

josh was evidently in dead earnest miller recalled very vividly the expression he had seen twice on his patients face during the journey to wellington he had often seen joshs mother old aunt millyâ  silly milly the children called herâ wandering aimlessly about the street muttering to herself incoherently he had felt a certain childish awe at the sight of one of gods creatures who had lost the light of reason and he had always vaguely understood that she was the victim of human cruelty though he had dated it farther back into the past this was his first knowledge of the real facts of the case

he realized too for a moment the continuity of life how inseparably the present is woven with the past how certainly the future will be but the outcome of the present he had supposed this old wound healed the negroes were not a vindictive people if swayed by passion or emotion they sometimes gave way to gusts of rage these were of brief duration absorbed in the contemplation of their doubtful present and their uncertain future they gave little thought to the past â it was a dark story which they would willingly forget he knew the timeworn explanation that the kuklux movement in the main was merely an ebullition of boyish spirits begun to amuse young white men by playing upon the fears and superstitions of ignorant negroes here however was its tragic side â the old wound still bleeding the fruit of one tragedy the seed of another he could not approve of joshs application of the mosaic law of revenge and yet the incident was not without significance here was a negro who could remember an injury who could shape his life to a definite purpose if not a high or holy one when his race reached the point where they would resent a wrong there was hope that they might soon attain the stage where they would try and if need be die to defend a right

this man too had a purpose in life and was willing to die that he might accomplish it miller was willing to give up his life to a cause would he be equally willing he asked himself to die for it  miller had no prophetic instinct to tell him how soon he would have the opportunity to answer his own question but he could not encourage josh to carry out this dark and revengeful purpose every worthy consideration required him to dissuade his patient from such a desperate course

 you had better put away these murderous fancies josh he said seriously  the bible says that we should  forgive our enemies bless them that curse us and do good to them that despitefully use us 

 yas suh ive larnt all dat in sundayschool an ive heared de preachers say it time an time agin but it pears ter me dat dis fergitfulniss an fergivniss is mighty onesided de wite folks don fergive nothin de niggers does dey got up de kuklux dey said on count er de kyarpitbaggers dey ben talkin bout de kyarpitbaggers ever sence an dey pears ter fergot all bout de kuklux but i ain fergot de niggers is ben train ter fergiveniss  an fer fear dey might fergit how ter fergive de wite folks gives em somethin new evy now an den ter practice on a wite man kin do wat he wants ter a nigger but de minute de nigger gits back at im up goes de nigger an don come down tell somebody cuts im down if a nigger gits a office er de race pears ter be prosperin too much de wite folks up an kills a few so dat de res kin keep on fergivin an bein thankful dat deyre lef alive don talk ter me bout dese wite folks â i knows em i does  ef a nigger wants ter git down on his marrowbones an eat dirt an call em  marster hes a good nigger dere s room fer him but i ain no wite folks nigger i ain i don call no man  marster i don wan nothin but wat i wok fer but i wants all er dat i never moless no wite man less n he moless me fus but wen de ole oman dies doctuh an i gits a good chance at dat wite man â dere ain no use talkin suh â deres gwine ter be a mixup an a funeal er two funeals â er may be mo ef anybody is keerliss enough to git in de way

 josh said the doctor laying a cool hand on the others brow  youre feverish and dont know what youre talking about i shouldnt let my mind dwell on such things and you must keep quiet until this arm is well or you may never be able to hit any one with it again

miller determined that when josh got better he would talk to him seriously and dissuade him from this dangerous design he had not asked the name of joshs enemy but the look of murderous hate which the dustbegrimed tramp of the railway journey had cast at captain george mc bane rendered any such question superfluous mc bane was probably deserving of any evil fate which might befall him  but such a revenge would do no good would right no wrong while every such crime committed by a colored man would be imputed to the race which was already staggering under a load of obloquy because in the eyes of a prejudiced and undiscriminating public it must answer as a whole for the offenses of each separate individual to die in defense of the right was heroic to kill another for revenge was pitifully human and weak vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord

old mr delameres servant sandy campbell was in deep trouble

a party of northern visitors had been staying for several days at the st james hotel the gentlemen of the party were concerned in a projected cotton mill while the ladies were much interested in the study of social conditions and especially in the negro problem as soon as their desire for information became known they were taken courteously under the wing of prominent citizens and their wives who gave them at elaborate luncheons the southern white mans views of the negro sighing sentimentally over the disappearance of the good old negro of before the war and gravely deploring the degeneracy of his descendants they enlarged upon the amount of money the southern whites had spent for the education of the negro and shook their heads over the inadequate results accruing from this unexampled generosity it was sad they said to witness this spectacle of a dying race unable to withstand the competition of a superior type the severe reprisals taken by white people for certain crimes committed by negroes were of course not the acts of the best people who deplored them but still a certain charity should be extended towards those who in the intense and righteous anger of the moment should take the law into their own hands and deal out rough but still substantial justice  for no negro was ever lynched without incontestable proof of his guilt in order to be perfectly fair and give their visitors an opportunity to see both sides of the question they accompanied the northern visitors to a colored church where they might hear a colored preacher who had won a jocular popularity throughout the whole country by an oftrepeated sermon intended to demonstrate that the earth was flat like a pancake this celebrated divine could always draw a white audience except on the days when his no less distinguished white rival in the field of sensationalism preached his equally famous sermon to prove that hell was exactly one half mile linear measure from the city limits of wellington whether accidentally or not the northern visitors had no opportunity to meet or talk alone with any colored person in the city except the servants at the hotel when one of the party suggested a visit to the colored mission school a southern friend kindly volunteered to accompany them

the visitors were naturally much impressed by what they learned from their courteous hosts and felt inclined to sympathize with the southern people for the negro is not counted as a southerner except to fix the basis of congressional representation there might of course be things to criticise here and there certain customs for which they did not exactly see the necessity and which seemed in conflict with the highest ideals of liberty but surely these courteous softspoken ladies and gentlemen entirely familiar with local conditions who descanted so earnestly and at times pathetically upon the grave problems confronting them must know more about it than people in the distant north without their means of information the negroes who waited on them at the hotel seemed happy enough and the teachers whom they had met at the mission school had been welldressed wellmannered and apparently content with their position in life surely a people who made no complaints could not be very much oppressed

in order to give the visitors ere they left wellington a pleasing impression of southern customs and particularly of the joyous happygolucky disposition of the southern darky and his entire contentment with existing conditions it was decided by the hotel management to treat them on the last night of their visit to a little diversion in the shape of a genuine negro cakewalk

on the afternoon of this same day tom delamere strolled into the hotel and soon gravitated to the bar where he was a frequent visitor young men of leisure spent much of their time around the hotel and no small part of it in the bar delamere had been to the club but had avoided the cardroom time hanging heavy on his hands he had sought the hotel in the hope that some form of distraction might present itself

have you heard the latest mr delamere asked the bartender as he mixed a cocktail for his customer

 no billy  what is it  

 theres to be a big cakewalk upstairs tonight the nothen gentlemen an ladies who are down here to see about the new cotton factry want to study the nigger some more and the boss has got up a cakewalk for em mongst the waiters and chambermaids with a little outside talent

 is it to be public   asked delamere

 oh no not generally but friends of the house wont be barred out the clerkll fix it for you ransom the head waiter will be floor manager

delamere was struck with a brilliant idea the more he considered it the brighter it seemed another cocktail imparted additional brilliancy to the conception he had been trying after a feeble fashion to keep his promise to clara and was really suffering from lack of excitement

he left the barroom found the head waiter held with him a short conversation and left in his intelligent and itching palm a piece of money

the cakewalk was a great success the most brilliant performer was a late arrival who made his appearance just as the performance was about to commence the newcomer was dressed strikingly the conspicuous features of his attire being a long blue coat with brass buttons and a pair of plaid trousers he was older too than the other participants which made his agility the more remarkable his partner was a new chambermaid who had just come to town and whom the head waiter introduced to the newcomer upon his arrival the cake was awarded to this couple by a unanimous vote the man presented it to his partner with a grandiloquent flourish and returned thanks in a speech which sent the northern visitors into spasms of delight at the quaintness of the darky dialect and the darky wit to cap the climax the winner danced a buck dance with a skill and agility that brought a shower of complimentary silver which he gathered up and passed to the head waiter

ellis was off duty for the evening not having ventured to put in an appearance at carterets since his last rebuff he found himself burdened with a superfluity of leisure from which he essayed to find relief by dropping into the hotel office at about nine oclock he was invited up to see the cakewalk which he rather enjoyed for there was some graceful dancing and posturing but the grotesque contortions of one participant had struck him as somewhat overdone even for the comical type of negro he recognized the fellow after a few minutes scrutiny as the bodyservant of old mr delamere the mans present occupation or choice of diversion seemed out of keeping with his employment as attendant upon an invalid old gentleman and strangely inconsistent with the gravity and decorum which had been so noticeable when this agile cakewalker had served as butler at major carterets table upon the occasion of the christening dinner there was a vague suggestion of unreality about this performance too which ellis did not attempt to analyze but which recurred vividly to his memory upon a subsequent occasion

ellis had never pretended to that intimate knowledge of negro thought and character by which some of his acquaintances claimed the ability to fathom every motive of a negros conduct and predict in advance what any one of the darker race would do under a given set of circumstances he would not have believed that a white man could possess two so widely varying phases of character but as to negroes they were as yet a crude and undeveloped race and it was not safe to make predictions concerning them no one could tell at what moment the thin veneer of civilization might peel off and reveal the underlying savage

the champion cakewalker much to the surprise of his sable companions who were about equally swayed by admiration and jealousy disappeared immediately after the close of the performance any one watching him on his way home through the quiet streets to old mr delameres would have seen him now and then shaking with laughter it had been excellent fun nevertheless as he neared home a certain aspect of the affair hitherto unconsidered occurred to him and it was in a rather serious frame of mind that he cautiously entered the house and sought his own room

the cakewalk had results which to sandy were very serious the following week he was summoned before the disciplinary committee of his church and charged with unchristian conduct in the following particulars to wit dancing and participating in a sinful diversion called a cakewalk which was calculated to bring the church into disrepute and make it the mockery of sinners

sandy protested his innocence vehemently but in vain the proof was overwhelming he was positively identified by sister manda patterson the hotel cook who had watched the whole performance from the hotel corridor for the sole single solitary and only purpose she averred of seeing how far human wickedness could be carried by a professing christian the whole thing had been shocking and offensive to her and only a stern sense of duty had sustained her in looking on that she might be qualified to bear witness against the offender she had recognized his face his clothes his voice his walk â there could be no shadow of doubt that it was brother sandy this testimony was confirmed by one of the deacons whose son a waiter at the hotel had also seen sandy at the cakewalk

sandy stoutly insisted that he was at home the whole evening  that he had not been near the hotel for three months that he had never in his life taken part in a cakewalk and that he did not know how to dance it was replied that wickedness like everything else must have a beginning that dancing was an art that could be acquired in secret and came natural to some people in the face of positive proof sandys protestations were of no avail he was found guilty and suspended from church fellowship until lie should have repented and made full confession

sturdily refusing to confess a fault of which he claimed to be innocent sandy remained in contumacy thereby falling somewhat into disrepute among the members of his church the largest in the city the effect of a bad reputation being subjective as well as objective and poor human nature arguing that one may as well have the game as the name sandy insensibly glided into habits of which the church would not have approved though he took care that they should not interfere with his duties to mr delamere the consolation thus afforded however followed as it was by remorse of conscience did not compensate him for the loss of standing in the church which to him was a social club as well as a religious temple at times in conversation with young delamere he would lament his hard fate

tom laughed until he cried at the comical idea which sandys plaint always brought up of halfadozen negro preachers sitting in solemn judgment upon that cakewalk â it had certainly been a good cakewalk â and sending poor sandy to spiritual coventry

 cheer up sandy cheer up   he would say when sandy seemed most depressed  go into my room and get yourself a good drink of liquor the devils church has a bigger congregation than theirs and we have the consolation of knowing that when we die well meet all our friends on the other side brace up sandy and be a man or if you cant be a man be as near a man as you can  

hoping to revive his drooping spirits sandy too often accepted the proffered remedy

when mrs carteret had fully recovered from the shock attendant upon the accident at the window where little dodie had so narrowly escaped death or serious injury she ordered her carriage one afternoon and directed the coachman to drive her to mrs ochiltrees

mrs carteret had discharged her young nurse only the day before and had sent for mammy jane who was now recovered from her rheumatism to stay until she could find another girl the nurse had been ordered not to take the child to negroes houses yesterday in driving past the old homestead of her husbands family now occupied by dr miller and his family mrs carteret had seen her own babys carriage standing in the yard

when the nurse returned home she was immediately discharged she offered some sort of explanation to the effect that her sister worked for mrs miller and that some family matter had rendered it necessary for her to see her sister the explanation only aggravated the offense if mrs carteret could have overlooked the disobedience she would by no means have retained in her employment a servant whose sister worked for the miller woman

old mrs ochiltree had within a few months begun to show signs of breaking up she was over seventy years old and had been of late by various afflictions confined to the house much of the time more than once within the year mrs carteret had asked her aunt to come and live with her but mrs ochiltree who would have regarded such a step as an acknowledgment of weakness preferred her lonely independence she resided in a small oldfashioned house standing back in the middle of a garden on a quiet street two old servants made up her modest household

this refusal to live with her niece had been lightly borne for mrs ochiltree was a woman of strong individuality whose comments upon her acquaintance present or absent were marked by a frankness at times no less than startling this characteristic caused her to be more or less avoided mrs ochiltree was aware of this sentiment on the part of her acquaintance and rather exulted in it she hated fools only fools ran away from her and that because they were afraid she would expose their folly if most people were fools it was no fault of hers and she was not obliged to indulge them by pretending to believe that they knew anything she had once owned considerable property but was reticent about her affairs and told no one how much she was worth though it was supposed that she had considerable ready money besides her house and some other real estate mrs carteret was her nearest living relative though her grandnephew tom delamere had been a great favorite with her if she did not spare him her tonguelashings it was nevertheless expected in the family that she would leave him something handsome in her will

mrs ochiltree had shared in the general rejoicing upon the advent of the carteret baby she had been one of his godmothers and had hinted at certain intentions held by her concerning him during mammy janes administration she had tried the old nurses patience more or less by her dictatorial interference since her partial confinement to the house she had gone when her health and the weather would permit to see the child and at other times had insisted that it be sent to her in charge of the nurse at least every other day

mrs ochiltrees faculties had shared insensibly in the decline of her health this weakness manifested itself by fits of absentmindedness in which she would seemingly lose connection with the present and live over again in imagination the earlier years of her life she had buried two husbands had tried in vain to secure a third and had never borne any children long ago she had petrified into a character which nothing under heaven could change and which if death is to take us as it finds us and the future life to keep us as it takes us promised anything but eternal felicity to those with whom she might associate after this life tom delamere had been heard to say profanely that if his aunt polly went to heaven he would let his mansion in the skies on a long lease at a low figure

when the carriage drove up with mrs carteret her aunt was seated on the little front piazza with her wrinkled hands folded in her lap dozing the afternoon away in fitful slumber

tie the horse william said mrs carteret and then go in and wake aunt polly and tell her i want her to come and drive with me

mrs ochiltree had not observed her nieces approach nor did she look up when william drew near pier eyes were closed and she would let her head sink slowely forward recovering it now and then with a spasmodic jerk

 colonel ochiltree she muttered  was shot at the battle of culpepper court house and left me a widow for the second time but i would not have married any man on earth after him

 mis ochiltree   cried william raising his voice  oh mis ochiltree  

if i had found a man â a real man â i might have married again i did not care for weaklings i could have married john delamere if i had wanted him but pshaw  i could have wound him round â  go round to the kitchen william interrupted mrs carteret impatiently  and tell aunt dinah to come and wake her up

william returned in a few moments with a fat comfortable looking black woman who curtsied to mrs carteret at the gate and then going up to her mistress seized her by the shoulder and shook her vigorously

 wake up dere mis polly she screamed as harshly as her mellow voice would permit  mis livy wants you ter go drivin wid er  

 dinah exclaimed the old lady sitting suddenly upright with a defiant assumption of wakefulness  why do you take so long to come when i call  bring me my bonnet and shawl dont you see my niece waiting for me at the gate  

 hyuh dey is hyuh dey is   returned dinah producing the bonnet and shawl and assisting mrs ochiltree to put them on

leaning on williams arm the old lady went slowly down the walk and was handed to the rear seat with mrs carteret

hows the baby today olivia and why didnt you bring him  

 he has a cold today and is a little hoarse replied mrs carteret  so i thought it best not to bring him out drive out the weldon road william and back by pine street

the drive led past an eminence crowned by a handsome brick building of modern construction evidently an institution of some kind surrounded on three sides by a grove of venerable oaks

 hugh poindexter mrs ochiltree exclaimed explosively after a considerable silence  has been building a new house in place of the old family mansion burned during the war

 it isnt mr poindexters house aunt polly that is the new colored hospital built by the colored doctor

 the new colored hospital indeed and the colored doctor before the war the negroes were all healthy and when they got sick we took care of them ourselves  hugh poindexter has sold the graves of his ancestors to a negro â i should have starved first 

 he had his grandfathers grave opened and there was nothing to remove except a few bits of heartpine from the coffin all the rest had crumbled into dust

 and he sold the dust to a negro  the world is upside down

 he had the tombstone transferred to the white cemetery aunt polly and he has moved away

esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage when i die if you outlive me olivia which is not likely i shall leave ray house and land to this child i he is a carteret â he would never sell them to a negro i cant trust tom delamere im afraid

the carriage had skirted the hill passing to the rear of the new building

 turn to the right william ordered mrs carteret addressing the coachman  and come back past the other side of the hospital

a turn to the right into another road soon brought them to the front of the building which stood slightly back from the street with no intervening fence or inclosure a sorrel pony in a light buggy was fastened to a hitchingpost near the entrance as they drove past a lady came out of the front door and descended the steps holding by the hand a very pretty child about six years old

 who is that woman olivia   asked mrs ochiltree abruptly with signs of agitation

the lady coming down the steps darted at the approaching carriage a look which lingered involuntarily

mrs carteret perceiving this glance turned away coldly

with a sudden hardening of her own features the other woman lifted the little boy into the buggy and drove sharply away in the direction opposite to that taken by mrs carterets carriage

 who is that woman olivia   repeated mrs ochiltree with marked emotion

 i have not the honor of her acquaintance returned mrs carteret sharply drive faster william

 i want to know who that woman is persisted mrs ochiltree querulously  william she cried shrilly poking the coachman in the back with the end of her cane  who is that woman  

 dats mis miller maam returned the coachman touching his hat doctuh millers wife

 what was her mothers name  

her mothers name wuz julia brown shes ben dead dese twenty years er mo why you knowed julia mis polly â she used ter blong ter yo own father befo de wah an after de wah she kep house fer  â  look to your horses william  exclaimed mrs carteret sharply

 its that hussys child said mrs ochiltree turning to her niece with great excitement  when your father died i turned the mother and the child out into the street the mother died and went to â the place provided for such as she if i hadnt been just in time olivia they would have turned you out i saved the property for you and your son you can thank me for it all 

 hush aunt polly for goodness sake  william will hear you tell me about it when you get home

mrs ochiltree was silent except for a few incoherent mumblings what she might say what distressing family secret she might repeat in williams hearing should she take another talkative turn was beyond conjecture

olivia looked anxiously around for something to distract her aunts attention and caught sight of a colored man dressed in sober gray who was coming toward the carriage

 theres mr delameres sandy  exclaimed mrs carteret touching her aunt on the arm  i wonder how his master is  sandy oh sandy 

sandy approached the carriage lifting his hat with a slight exaggeration of chesterfieldian elegance sandy no less than his master was a survival of an interesting type he had inherited the feudal deference for his superiors in position joined to a certain selfrespect which saved him from sycophancy his manners had been formed upon those of old mr helamere and were not a bad imitation  for in the man as in the master they were the harmonious reflection of a mental state

 how is mr delamere sandy   asked mrs carteret acknowledging sandys salutation with a nod and a smile

 he aint ez peart ez he has ben maam replied sandy  but hes doin tolable well he doctuh say hes good fer a dozen years yit ef youll jes take good keer of hissef an keep fm gittin excited fer sence dat secon stroke excitement is dangeous fer im

 im sure you take the best care of him returned mrs carteret kindly

you cant do anything for him sandy interposed old mrs ochiltree shaking her head slowly to emphasize her dissent  all the doctors in creation couldnt keep him alive another year i shall outlive him by twenty years though we are not far from the same age

 lawd maam   exclaimed sandy lifting his hands in affected amazement â his study of gentle manners had been more than superficial â  whoever would a spicion dat you an mars john wuz nigh de same age  id a lowed you wuz ten years younger n him easy ef you wuz a day  

 give my compliments to the poor old gentleman returned mrs ochiltree with a simper of senile vanity though her back was weakening under the strain of the effort to sit erect that she might maintain this illusion of comparative youthfulness  bring him to see me some day when he is able to walk

yasm i will rejoined sandy hes gwine out ter belleview nex week fer ter stay a mont er so but ill fetch him roun wen he comes back ill tell im dat you ladies quired fer im

sandy made another deep bow and held his hat in his hand until the carriage had moved away he had not condescended to notice the coachman at all who was one of the young negroes of the new generation while sandy regarded himself as belonging to the quality and seldom stooped to notice those beneath him it would not have been becoming in him either while conversing with white ladies to have noticed a colored servant moreover the coachman was a baptist while sandy was a methodist though under a cloud and considered a methodist in poor standing as better than a baptist of any degree of sanctity

 lawd lawd  chuckled sandy after the carriage had departed  i never seed nothin lack de way dat ole lady do keep up her temper wid one foot in de grave an de other hovrin on de edge she talks bout my ole marster lack he wuz in his secon chilhood but im jes willin ter bet dat youll outlas her she aint half de woman she wuz dat night i waited on de table at de christenin paty wen she lowed she wuz n feared er no man livin

as a stone dropped into a pool of water sets in motion a series of concentric circles which disturb the whole mass in varying degree so mrs ochiltrees enigmatical remark had started in her nieces mind a disturbing train of thought had her words mrs carteret asked herself any serious meaning or were they the mere empty babblings of a clouded intellect

william she said to the coachman when they reached mrs ochiltrees house you may tie the horse and help us out i shall be here a little while william helped the ladies down assisted mrs ochiltree into the house and then went round to the kitchen dinah was an excellent hand at potatopone and other culinary delicacies dear to the southern heart and william was a welcome visitor in her domain

 now aunt polly said mrs carteret resolutely as soon as they were alone  i want to know what you meant by what you said about my father and julia and this â this child of hers

the old woman smiled cunningly but her expression soon changed to one more grave

why do you want to know she asked suspiciously youve got the land the houses and the money youve nothing to complain of enjoy yourself and be thankful  

im thankful to god returned olivia for all his good gifts â and he has blessed me abundantly â but why should i be thankful to you for the property my father left me  

 why should you be thankful to me   rejoined mrs ochiltree with querulous indignation youd better ask why should nt you be thankful to me what have i not done for you 

 yes aunt polly i know youve done a great deal you reared me in your own house when i had been cast out of my fathers you have been a second mother to me and i am very gratefulâyou can never say that i have not shown my gratitude but if you have done anything else for me i wish to know it why should i thank you for my inheritance  

 why should you thank me  well because i drove that woman and her brat away

 but she had no right to stay aunt polly after father died of course she had no moral right before but it was his house and he could keep her there if he chose but after his death she surely had no right

 perhaps not so surely as you think â if she had not been a negro had she been white there might have been a difference when i told her to go she said  â  what did she say aunt polly demanded olivia eagerly

it seemed for a moment as though mrs ochiltree would speak no further but her once strong will now weakened by her bodily infirmities yielded to the influence of her nieces imperious demand

 ill tell you the whole story she said  and then youll know what i did for you and yours

mrs ochiltrees eyes assumed an introspective expression and her story as it advanced became as keenly dramatic as though memory had thrown aside the veil of intervening years and carried her back directly to the events which she now described

your father she said while living with that woman left home one morning the picture of health five minutes later he tottered into the house groaning with pain stricken unto death by the hand of a just god as a punishment for his sins

olivia gave a start of indignation but restrained herself

 i was at once informed of what had happened for i had means of knowing all that took place in the household old jane â she was younger then â had come with you to my house but her daughter remained and through her i learned all that went on

 i hastened immediately to the house entered without knocking and approached mr merkells bedroom which was on the lower floor and opened into the hall the door was ajar and as i stood there for a moment i heard your fathers voice

  listen julia he was saying i shall not live until the doctor comes but i wish you to know dear julia  â he called her  dear julia  â  before i die that i have kept my promise you did me one great service juliaâyou saved me from polly ochiltree  yes olivia that is what he said  you have served me faithfully and well and i owe you a great deal which i have tried to pay   oh mr merkell dear mr merkell cried the hypocritical hussy falling to her knees by his bedside and shedding her crocodile tears  you owe me nothing you have done more for me than i could ever repay you will not die and leave meâno no it cannot be    yes i am going to die â i am dying now julia but listen â compose yourself and listen for this is a more important matter take the keys from under my pillow open the desk in the next room look in the second drawer on the right and you will find an envelope containing three papers one of them is yours one is the paper i promised to make and the third is a letter which i wrote last night as soon as the breath has left my body deliver the envelope to the address indorsed upon it do not delay one moment or you may live to regret it say nothing until you have delivered the package and then be guided by the advice which you receive â it will come from a friend of mine who will not see you wronged  i slipped away from the door without making my presence known and entered by a door from the hall the room adjoining the one where mr merkell lay a moment later there was a loud scream returning quickly to the hall i entered mr merkells room as though just arrived

  how is mr merkell   i demanded as i crossed the threshold

  he is dead sobbed the woman without lifting her head â she had fallen on her knees by the bedside she had good cause to weep for my time had come

  get up i said you have no right here you pollute mr merkells dead body by your touch leave the house immediately â your day is over    i will not  she cried rising to her feet and facing me with brazenfaced impudence  i have a right to stay â he has given me the right   ha ha  i laughed  mr merkell is dead and i am mistress here henceforth go and go at once â do you hear   i hear but i shall not heed i can prove my rights i shall not leave     very well i replied  we shall see the law will decide i left the room but did not leave the house on the contrary i concealed myself where i could see what took place in the room adjoining the deathchamber

 she entered the room a moment later with her child on one arm and the keys in the other hand placing the child on the floor she put the key in the lock and seemed surprised to find the desk already unfastened she opened the desk picked up a roll of money and a ladies watch which first caught her eye and was reaching toward the drawer upon the right when i interrupted her â   well thief are you trying to strip the house before you leave it    she gave an involuntary cry clasped one hand to her bosom and with the other caught up her child and stood like a wild beast at bay

  i am not a thief she panted  the things are mine  you lie i replied you have no right to them â no more right than you have to remain in this house     i have a right she persisted  and i can prove it   she turned toward the desk seized the drawer and drew it open never shall i forget her look â never shall i forget that moment it was the happiest of my life the drawer was empty

 pale as death she turned and faced me

  the papers  she shrieked the papers  you have stolen them     papers   i laughed  what papers  do you take me for a thief like yourself    there were papers here she cried  only a minute since they are mine â give them back to me    listen woman i said sternly  you are lying â or dreaming my brotherinlaws papers are doubtless in his safe at his office where they ought to be as for the rest âyou are a thief   i am not she screamed   i am his wife he married me and the papers that were in the desk will prove it   listen i exclaimed when she had finished â  listen carefully and take heed to what i say you are a liar you have no proofs â there never were any proofs of what you say because it never happened â it is absurd upon the face of it not one person in wellington would believe it why should he marry you  he did not need to  you are merely lying â you are not even selfdeceived if he had really married you you would have made it known long ago that you did not is proof that your story is false  she was hit so hard that she trembled and sank into a chair but i had no mercy â she had saved your father from me â  dear julia indeed

  stand up i ordered  do not dare to sit down in my presence i have you on the hip my lady and will teach you your place  she struggled to her feet and stood supporting herself with one hand on the chair i could have killed her olivia  she had been my fathers slave  if it had been before the war i would have had her whipped to death

 you are a thief i said  and of that there are proofs i have caught you in the act the watch in your bosom is my own the money belongs to mr merkells estate which belongs to my niece his daughter olivia i saw you steal them my word is worth yours a hundred times over for i am a lady and you are â what and now hear me  if ever you breathe to a living soul one word of this preposterous story i will charge you with the theft and have you sent to the penitentiary your child will be taken from you and you shall never see it again i will give you now just ten minutes to take your brat and your rags out of this house forever but before you go put down your plunder there upon the desk  she laid down the money and the watch and a few minutes later left the house with the child in her arms

 and now olivia you know how i saved your estate and why you should be grateful to me

olivia had listened to her aunts story with intense interest having perceived the old womans mood and fearful lest any interruption might break the flow of her narrative she had with an effort kept back the one question which had been hovering upon her lips but which could now no longer be withheld

 what became of the papers aunt polly  

 ha ha   chuckled mrs ochiltree with a cunning look  did i not tell you that she found no papers   a change had come over mrs ochiltrees face marking the reaction from her burst of energy her eyes were half closed and she was muttering incoherently olivia made some slight effort to arouse her but in vain and realizing the futility of any further attempt to extract information from her aunt at this time she called william and drove homeward

late one afternoon a handsome trap drawn by two spirited bays drove up to carterets gate three places were taken by mrs carteret clara and the major leaving the fourth seat vacant

 ive asked ellis to drive out with us said the major as he took the lines from the colored man who had the trap in charge  well go by the office and pick him up

clara frowned but perceiving mrs carterets eye fixed upon her restrained any further expression of annoyance

the majors liking for ellis had increased within the year the young man was not only a good journalist but possessed sufficient cleverness and tact to make him excellent company the major was fond of argument but extremely tenacious of his own opinions ellis handled the foils of discussion with just the requisite skill to draw out the major permitting himself to be vanquished not too easily but as it were inevitably by the majors incontrovertible arguments

olivia had long suspected ellis of feeling a more than friendly interest in clara herself partial to tom she had more than once thought it hardly fair to delamere or even to clara who was young and impressionable to have another young man constantly about the house true there had seemed to be no great danger for ellis had neither the family nor the means to make him a suitable match for the majors sister  nor had clara made any secret of her dislike for ellis or of her resentment for his supposed depreciation of delamere mrs carteret was inclined to a more just and reasonable view of elliss conduct in this matter but nevertheless did not deem it wise to undeceive clara dislike was a stout barrier which remorse might have broken down the major absorbed in schemes of empire and dreams of his childs future had not become cognizant of the affair his wife out of friendship for tom had refrained from mentioning it while the major with a delicate regard for claras feelings had said nothing at home in regard to his interview with her lover

at the chronicle office ellis took the front seat beside the major after leaving the city pavements they bowled along merrily over an excellent tollroad built of oyster shells from the neighboring sound stopping at intervals to pay toll to the gatekeepers most of whom were white women with tallow complexions and snuffstained lips â the traditional  poorwhite for part of the way the road was bordered with a growth of scrub oak and pine interspersed with stretches of cleared land white with the opening cotton or yellow with ripening corn to the right along the distant riverbank were visible here and there groups of turpentine pines though most of this growth had for some years been exhausted twenty years before wellington had been the worlds greatest shipping port for naval stores but as the turpentine industry had moved southward leaving a trail of devastated forests in its rear the city had fallen to a poor fifth or sixth place in this trade relying now almost entirely upon cotton for its export business

occasionally our party passed a person or a group of persons â mostly negroes approximating the pure type for those of lighter color grew noticeably scarcer as the town was left behind now and then one of these would salute the party respectfully while others glanced at them indifferently or turned away there would have seemed to a stranger a lack of spontaneous friendliness between the people of these two races as though each felt that it had no part or lot in the others life at one point the carriage drew near a party of colored folks who were laughing and jesting among themselves with great glee paying no attention to the white people they continued to laugh and shout boisterously as the carriage swept by

major carterets countenance wore an angry look

 the negroes around this town are becoming absolutely insufferable he averred  they are sadly in need of a lesson in manners

half an hour later they neared another group who were also making merry as the carriage approached they became mute and silent as the grave until the majors party had passed

 the negroes are a sullen race remarked the major thoughtfully  they will learn their lesson in a rude school and perhaps much sooner than they dream by the way he added turning to the ladies  what was the arrangement with tom  was he to come out this evening

 he came out early in the afternoon replied clara  to go afishing he is to join us at the hotel

after an hours drive they reached the hotel in front of which stretched the beach white and inviting along the shallow sound mrs carteret and clara found seats on the veranda having turned the trap over to a hostler the major joined a group of gentlemen among whom was general belmont and was soon deep in the discussion of the standing problem of how best to keep the negroes down

ellis remained by the ladies clara seemed restless and ill at ease half an hour elapsed and delamere had not appeared

 i wonder where tom is said mrs carteret

 i guess he hasnt come in yet from fishing said clara  i wish he would come it s lonesome here mr ellis would you mind looking about the hotel and seeing if theres any one here that we know 

for ellis the party was already one too large he had accepted this invitation eagerly hoping to make friends with clara during the evening he had never been able to learn definitely the reason of her coldness but had dated it from his meeting with old mrs ochiltree with which he felt it was obscurely connected he had noticed delameres scowling look too at their last meeting claras injustice whatever its cause he felt keenly to delameres scowl he had paid little attention â he despised tom so much that but for his engagement to clara he would have held his opinions in utter contempt

he had even wished that clara might make some charge against him â he would have preferred that to her attitude of studied indifference the only redeeming feature about which was that it was studied showing that she at least had him in mind the next best thing he reasoned to having a woman love you is to have her dislike you violently â the main point is that you should be kept in mind and made the subject of strong emotions he thought of the story of hall caines where the woman after years of persecution at the hands of an unwelcome suitor is on the point of yielding out of sheer irresistible admiration for the mans strength and persistency when the lover unaware of his victory and despairing of success seizes her in his arms and springing into the sea finds a watery grave for both the analogy of this case with his own was of course not strong he did not anticipate any tragedy in their relations but he was glad to be thought of upon almost any terms he would not have done a mean thing to make her think of him  but if she did so because of a misconception which he was given no opportunity to clear up while at the same time his conscience absolved him from evil and gave him the compensating glow of martyrdom it was at least better than nothing

he would of course have preferred to be upon a different footing it had been a pleasure to have her speak to him during the drive â they had exchanged a few trivial remarks in the general conversation it was a greater pleasure to have her ask a favor of him â a pleasure which in this instance was partly offset when he interpreted her request to mean that he was to look for tom delamere he accepted the situation gracefully however and left the ladies alone

knowing delameres habits he first went directly to the barroomâthe atmosphere would be congenial even if he were not drinking delamere was not there stepping next into the office he asked the clerk if young mr delamere had been at the hotel

yes sir returned the man at the desk he was here at luncheon and then went out fishing in a boat with several other gentlemen i think they came back about three oclock ill find out for you

he rang the bell to which a colored boy responded

front said the clerk see if young mr delameres upstairs look in  or  and let me know at once

the bellboy returned in a moment

 yas sub he reported with a suppressed grin  hes in  suh de do was open an i seed im from de hall suh

 i wish youd go up and tell him said ellis  that âwhat are you grinning about   he asked suddenly noticing the waiters expression

 nothin suh nothin at all suh responded the negro lapsing into the stolidity of a wooden indian  what shall i tell mr delamere suh  

 tell him resumed ellis still watching the boy suspiciously â  no ill tell him myself

he ascended the broad stair to the second floor there was an upper balcony and a parlor with a piano for the musically inclined to reach these one had to pass along the hall upon which the room mentioned by the bellboy opened ellis was quite familiar with the hotel he could imagine circumstances under which he would not care to speak to delamere he would merely pass through the hall and glance into the room casually as any one else might do and see what the darky downstairs might have meant by his impudence

it required but a moment to reach the room the door was not wide open but far enough ajar for him to see what was going on within

two young men members of the fast set at the clarendon club were playing cards at a small table near which stood another decorated with an array of empty bottles and glasses sprawling on a lounge with flushed face and disheveled hair his collar unfastened his vest buttoned awry lay tom delamere breathing stertorously in what seemed a drunken sleep lest there should be any doubt of the cause of his condition the fingers of his right hand had remained clasped mechanically around the neck of a bottle which lay across his bosom

ellis turned away in disgust and went slowly back to the ladies

 there seems to be no one here yet he reported  we came a little early for the evening crowd the clerk says tom delamere was here to luncheon but he hasnt seen him for several hours

 he s not a very gallant cavalier said mrs carteret severely  he ought to have been waiting for us

clara was clearly disappointed and made no effort to conceal her displeasure leaving ellis in doubt as to whether or not he were its object perhaps she suspected him of not having made a very thorough search her next remark might have borne such a construction

 sister olivia she said pettishly  lets go up to the parlor i can play the piano anyway if theres no one to talk to

 i find it very comfortable here clara replied her sister placidly  mr ellis will go with you youll probably find some one in the parlor or theyll come when you begin to play

claras expression was not cordial but she rose as if to go ellis was in a quandary if she went through the hall the chances were at least even that she would see delamere he did not care a rap for delamere â if he chose to make a public exhibition of himself it was his own affair but to see him would surely spoil miss pembertons evening and in her frame of mind might lead to the suspicion that ellis had prearranged the exposure even if she should not harbor this unjust thought she would not love the witness of her discomfiture we had rather not meet the persons who have seen even though they never mention the skeletons in our closets delamere had disposed of himself for the evening ellis would have a fairer field with delamere out of sight and unaccounted for than with delamere in evidence in his present condition

wouldnt you rather take a stroll on the beach miss clara he asked in the hope of creating a diversion

 no im going to the parlor you neednt come mr ellis if youd rather go down to the beach i can quite as well go alone

 id rather go with you he said meekly

they were moving toward the door opening into the hall from which the broad staircase ascended ellis whose thoughts did not always respond quickly to a sudden emergency was puzzling his brain as to how he should save her from any risk of seeing delamere through the side door leading from the hall into the office he saw the bellboy to whom he had spoken seated on the bench provided for the servants

 wont you wait for me just a moment miss clara while i step into the office ill be with you in an instant

clara hesitated

 oh certainly she replied nonchalantly

ellis went direct to the bellboy  sit right where you are he said  and dont move a hair what is the lady in the hall doing  

 shes got her back tuned this way suh i spec shes lookin at the picture on the opposite wall suh

 all right whispered ellis pressing a coin into the servants hand  im going up to the parlor with the lady you go up ahead of us and keep in front of us along the hall dont dare to look back i shall keep on talking to the lady so that you can tell by my voice where we are when you get to room  go in and shut the door behind you pretend that you were called â ask the gentlemen what they want â tell any kind of a lie you like â but keep the door shut until youre sure weve got by do you hear  

yes suh replied the negro intelligently

the plan worked without a hitch ellis talked steadily about the hotel the furnishings all sorts of irrelevant subjects to which miss pemberton paid little attention she was angry with delamere and took no pains to conceal her feelings the bellboy entered room  just before they reached the door ellis had heard loud talking as they approached and as they were passing there was a crash of broken glass as though some object had been thrown at the door

 what is the matter there   exclaimed clara quickening her footsteps and instinctively drawing closer to ellis

 some one dropped a glass i presume replied ellis calmly

miss pemberton glanced at him suspiciously she was in a decidedly perverse mood seating herself at the piano she played brilliantly for a quarter of an hour quite a number of couples strolled up to the parlor but delamere was not among them

 oh dear   exclaimed miss pemberton as she let her fingers fall upon the keys with a discordant crash after the last note  i dont see why we came out here tonight lets go back downstairs

ellis felt despondent he had done his utmost to serve and to please miss pemberton but was not likely he foresaw to derive much benefit from his opportunity delamere was evidently as much or more in her thoughts by reason of his absence than if he had been present if the door should have been opened and she should see him from the hall upon their return ellis could not help it he took the side next to the door however meaning to hurry past the room so that she might not recognize delamere

fortunately the door was closed and all quiet within the room on the stairway they met the bellboy rubbing his head with one hand and holding a bottle of seltzer upon a tray in the other the boy was well enough trained to give no sign of recognition though ellis guessed the destination of the bottle

ellis hardly knew whether to feel pleased or disappointed at the success of his manoeuvres he had spared miss pemberton some mortification but he had saved tom delamere from merited exposure clara ought to know the truth for her own sake

on the beach a few rods away fires were burning around which several merry groups had gathered the smoke went mostly to one side but a slight whiff came now and then to where mrs carteret sat awaiting them

 theyre roasting oysters said mrs carteret  i wish you d bring me some mr ellis

ellis strolled down to the beach a large iron plate with a turnedup rim like a great bakingpan supported by legs which held it off the ground was set over a fire built upon the sand this primitive oven was heaped with small oysters in the shell taken from the neighboring sound and hauled up to the hotel by a negro whose pony cart stood near by a wet coffeesack of burlaps was spread over the oysters which when steamed sufficiently were opened by a colored man and served gratis to all who cared for them

ellis secured a couple of plates of oysters which he brought to mrs carteret and clara they were small but finely flavored

meanwhile delamere who possessed a remarkable faculty of recuperation from the effects of drink had waked from his sleep and remembering his engagement had exerted himself to overcome the ravages of the afternoons debauch a dash of cold water braced him up somewhat a bottle of seltzer and a big cup of strong coffee still further strengthened his nerves

when ellis returned to the veranda after having taken away the plates delamere had joined the ladies and was explaining the cause of his absence

he had been overcome by the heat he said while out fishing and had been lying down ever since perhaps he ought to have sent for a doctor but the fellows had looked after him he hadnt sent word to his friends because he hadnt wished to spoil their evening

 that was very considerate of you tom said mrs carteret dryly  but you ought to have let us know we have been worrying about you very much clara has found the evening dreadfully dull

 indeed no sister olivia said the young lady cheerfully  ive been having a lovely time mr ellis and i have been up in the parlor i played the piano and weve been eating oysters and having a most delightful time wont you take me down there to the beach mr ellis  i want to see the fires come on

 cant i go   asked tom jealously

no indeed you mustnt stir a foot you must not overtax yourself so soon it might do you serious injury stay here with sister olivia

she took elliss arm with exaggerated cordiality delamere glared after them angrily ellis did not stop to question her motives but took the goods the gods provided with no very great apparent effort miss pemberton became quite friendly and they strolled along the beach in sight of the hotel for nearly half an hour as they were coming up she asked him abruptly â mr ellis did you know tom was in the hotel

ellis was looking across the sound at the lights of a distant steamer which was making her way toward the harbor

 i wonder he said musingly as though he had not heard her question if that is the ocean belle

 and was he really sick   she demanded

 shes later than usual this trip continued ellis pursuing his thought  she was due about five oclock

miss pemberton under cover of the darkness smiled a fine smile which foreboded ill for some one when they joined the party on the piazza the major had come up and was saying that it was time to go he had been engaged in conversation for most of the evening with general belmont and several other gentlemen

 here comes the general now let me see there are five of us the general has offered me a seat in his buggy and tom can go with youall

the general came up and spoke to the ladies tom murmured his thanks it would enable him to make up a part of the delightful evening he had missed

when mrs carteret had taken the rear seat clara promptly took the place beside her ellis and delamere sat in front when delamere who had offered to drive took the reins ellis saw that his hands were shaking

 give me the lines he whispered yournerves are unsteady and the road is not well lighted

delamere prudently yielded the reins he did not like elliss tone which seemed sneering rather than expressive of sympathy with one who had been suffering he wondered if the beggar knew anything about his illness clara had been acting strangely it would have been just like ellis to have slandered him the upstart had no business with clara anyway he would cheerfully have strangled ellis if he could have done so with safety to himself and no chance of discovery

the drive homeward through the night was almost a silent journey mrs carteret was anxious about her baby clara did not speak except now and then to ellis with reference to some object in or near the road occasionally they passed a vehicle in the darkness sometimes barely avoiding a collision far to the north the sky was lit up with the glow of a forest fire the breeze from the sound was deliciously cool soon the last tollgate was passed and the lights of the town appeared

ellis threw the lines to william who was waiting and hastened to help the ladies out

 goodnight mr ellis said clara sweetly as she gave ellis her hand  thank you for a very pleasant evening come up and see us soon

she ran into the house without a word to tom

it was only eleven oclock and delamere not being at all sleepy and feeling somewhat out of sorts as the combined results of his afternoons debauch and the snubbing he had received at claras hands directed the majors coachman who had taken charge of the trap upon its arrival to drive him to the st james hotel before returning the horses to the stable first however the coachman left ellis at his boardinghouse which was near by the two young men parted with as scant courtesy as was possible without an open rupture

delamere hoped to find at the hotel some form of distraction to fill in an hour or two before going home ill fortune favored him by placing in his way the burly form of captain george mc bane who was sitting in an armchair alone smoking a midnight cigar under the hotel balcony upon delameres making known his desire for amusement the captain proposed a small game of poker in his own room

mc bane had been waiting for some such convenient opportunity we have already seen that the captain was desirous of social recognition which he had not yet obtained beyond the superficial acquaintance acquired by association with men about town he had determined to assault society in its citadel by seeking membership in the clarendon club of which most gentlemen of the best families of the city were members

the clarendon club was a historic institution and its membership a social cult the temple of which was located just off the main street of the city in a dignified old colonial mansion which had housed it for the nearly one hundred years during which it had maintained its existence unbroken there had grown up around it many traditions and special usages membership in the clarendon was the sine qua non of high social standing and was conditional upon two of three things â birth wealth and breeding breeding was the prime essential but with rare exceptions must be backed by either birth or money

having decided therefore to seek admission into this social arcanum the captain who had either not quite appreciated the standard of the clarendons membership or had failed to see that he fell beneath it looked about for an intermediary through whom to approach the object of his desire he had already thought of tom delamere in this connection having with him such an acquaintance as one forms around a hotel and having long ago discovered that delamere was a young man of superficially amiable disposition vicious instincts lax principles and a weak will and which was quite as much to the purpose a member of the clarendon club possessing mental characteristics almost entirely opposite delamere and the captain had certain tastes in common and had smoked drunk and played cards together more than once

still more to his purpose mc bane had detected delamere trying to cheat him at cards he had said nothing about this discovery but had merely noted it as something which at some future time might prove useful the captain had not suffered by delameres deviation from the straight line of honor for while tom was as clever with the cards as might be expected of a young man who had devoted most of his leisure for several years to handling them mc bane was past master in their manipulation during a stormy career he had touched more or less pitch and had escaped few sorts of defilement

the appearance of delamere at a late hour unaccompanied and wearing upon his countenance an expression in which the captain read aright the craving for mental and physical excitement gave him the opportunity for which he had been looking mc bane was not the man to lose an opportunity nor did delamere require a second invitation neither was it necessary during the progress of the game for the captain to press upon his guest the contents of the decanter which stood upon the table within convenient reach

the captain permitted delamere to win from him several small amounts after which he gradually increased the stakes and turned the tables

delamere with every instinct of a gamester was no more a match for mc bane in selfcontrol than in skill when the young man had lost all his money the captain expressed his entire willingness to accept notes of hand for which he happened to have convenient blanks in his apartment

when delamere flushed with excitement and wine rose from the gaming table at two oclock he was vaguely conscious that he owed mc bane a considerable sum but could not have stated how much his opponent who was entirely cool and collected ran his eye carelessly over the bits of paper to which delamere had attached his signature

just one thousand dollars even he remarked

the announcement of this total had as sobering an effect upon delamere as though he had been suddenly deluged with a shower of cold water for a moment he caught his breath he had not a dollar in the world with which to pay this sum his only source of income was an allowance from his grandfather the monthly installment of which drawn that very day he had just lost to mc bane before starting in upon the notes of hand

 ill give you your revenge another time said mc bane as they rose  luck is against you tonight and im unwilling to take advantage of a clever young fellow like you meantime he added tossing the notes of hand carelessly on a bureau  dont worry about these bits of paper such small matters shouldnt cut any figure between friends but if you are around the hotel tomorrow i should like to speak to you upon another subject

very well captain returned tom somewhat ungraciously

delamere had been completely beaten with his own weapons he had tried desperately to cheat mc bane he knew perfectly well that mc bane had discovered his efforts and had cheated him in turn for the captains play had clearly been gauged to meet his own the biter had been bit and could not complain of the outcome

the following afternoon mc bane met delamere at the hotel and bluntly requested the latter to propose him for membership in the clarendon club

delamere was annoyed at this request his aristocratic gorge rose at the presumption of this son of an overseer and exdriver of convicts mc bane was good enough to win money from or even to lose money to but not good enough to be recognized as a social equal he would instinctively have blackballed mc bane had he been proposed by some one else with what grace could he put himself forward as the sponsor for this impossible social aspirant  moreover it was clearly a vulgar coldblooded attempt on mc banes part to use his power over him for a personal advantage

 well now captain mc bane returned delamere diplomatically  ive never put any one up yet and its not regarded as good form for so young a member as myself to propose candidates id much rather youd ask some older man

oh well replied mc bane just as you say only i thought you had cut your eye teeth

delamere was not pleased with mc banes tone his remark was not acquiescent though couched in terms of assent there was a sneering savagery about it too that left delamere uneasy he was in a measure in mc banes power he could not pay the thousand dollars unless it fell from heaven or he could win it from some one else he would not dare go to his grandfather for help mr delamere did not even know that his grandson gambled he might not have objected perhaps to a gentlemans game with moderate stakes but he would certainly tom knew very well have looked upon a thousand dollars as a preposterous sum to be lost at cards by a man who had nothing with which to pay it it was part of mr delameres creed that a gentleman should not make debts that he was not reasonably able to pay

there was still another difficulty if he had lost the money to a gentleman anti it had been his first serious departure from mr delameres perfectly well understood standard of honor tom might have risked a confession and thrown himself on his grandfathers mercy but he owed other sums here and there which to his just now much disturbed imagination loomed up in alarming number and amount he had recently observed signs of coldness too on the part of certain members of the club moreover like most men with one commanding vice he was addicted to several subsidiary forms of iniquity which in case of a scandal were more than likely to come to light he was clearly and most disagreeably caught in the net of his own hypocrisy his grandfather believed him a model of integrity a pattern of honor he could not afford to have his grandfather undeceived

he thought of old mrs ochiltree if she were a liberal soul she could give him a thousand dollars now when he needed it instead of making him wait until she died which might not be for ten years or more for a legacy which was steadily growing less and might be entirely exhausted if she lived long enough â some old people were very tenacious of life she was a careless old woman too he reflected and very foolishly kept her money in the house latterly she had been growing weak and childish some day she might be robbed and then his prospective inheritance from that source would vanish into thin air

with regard to this debt to mc bane if he could not pay it he could at least gain a long respite by proposing the captain at the club true he would undoubtedly be blackballed but before this inevitable event his name must remain posted for several weeks during which interval mc bane would be conciliatory on the other hand to propose mc bane would arouse suspicion of his own motives it might reach his grandfathers ears and lead to a demand for an explanation which it would be difficult to make clearly the better plan would be to temporize with mc bane with the hope that something might intervene to remove this cursed obligation

 suppose captain he said affably  we leave the matter open for a few days this is a thing that cant be rushed ill feel the pulse of my friends and yours and when we get the lay of the land the affair can be accomplished much more easily

 well thats better returned mc bane somewhat mollified â  if youll do that

 to be sure i will replied tom easily too much relieved to resent if not too preoccupied to perceive the implied doubt of his veracity

mc bane ordered and paid for more drinks and they parted on amicable terms

well let these notes stand for the time being tom said mc bane with significant emphasis when they separated

delamere winced at the familiarity he had reached that degree of moral deterioration where while principles were of little moment the externals of social intercourse possessed an exaggerated importance mc bane had never before been so personal he had addressed the young aristocrat first as  mr delamere then as their acquaintance advanced as  delamere he had now reached the abbreviated christian name stage of familiarity there was no lower depth to which tom could sink unless mc bane should invent a nickname by which to address him

he did not like mc banes manner â it was characterized by a veiled insolence which was exceedingly offensive he would go over to the club and try his luck with some honest player â perhaps something might turn up to relieve him from his embarrassment

he put his hand in his pocket mechanically â and found it empty in the present state of his credit he could hardly play without money

a thought struck him leaving the hotel he hastened home where he found sandy dusting his famous suit of clothes on the back piazza mr delamere was not at home having departed for belle view about two oclock leaving sandy to follow him in the morning

 hello sandy exclaimed tom with an assumed jocularity which he was very far from feeling  what are you doing with those gorgeous garments  

 im adustin of em mistuh tom dats wat im adoin heres somethin wrong bout dese clos er mine â i don never seem ter be able ter keep em clean no mo ef i blieved in dem oletimey sayins id low dere wuz a witch come here evey night an tuk em out an wro em er tuk me out an rid me in em dere wuz somethin wrong bout dat cakewalk business too dat i ain never undestood an don know how ter count fer less dere wuz some kin er deviishness goin on dat don show on de suface

yas suh i got de money mars john give me ter git dem things ter take out ter belleview in de mawnin

 there there sandy returned tom in a conciliatory tone  i beg your pardon  ive been associating with some northern white folks at the hotel and picked up the word from them youre a hightoned colored gentleman sandy â the finest one on the footstool

still muttering to himself sandy retired to his own room which was in the house so that he might be always near his master he soon returned with a timestained leather pocketbook and a coarseknit cotton sock from which two receptacles he painfully extracted a number of bills and coins

you count dat mistuh tom so ill know how much im lettin you have

 this isnt worth anything said tom pushing aside one roll of bills  its confederate money

 so it is suh it aint wuth nothin now but it has ben money an who kin tell but what it mought be money agin  de rest er dem bills is greenbacks âdeyll pass all right i reckon

the good money amounted to about fifty dollars which delamere thrust eagerly into his pocket

 you wont say anything to grandfather about this will you sandy he said as he turned away

 no suh cose i wont does i ever tell im bout yo gwineson  ef i did he added to himself as the young man disappeared down the street  i would n have time ter do nothin ese hadly i don know whether ill ever see dat money agin er no do imagine de ole genteman would n lemme lose it ef he knowed but i ain gwine ter tell him whether i git my money back er no fer he is jes so wrop up in dat boy dat i blieve it d jes break his heat ter fin out how hes ben gwine on doctuh price has tol me not ter let de ole genteman git ixcited er ese dere s no tellin wat mought happen hes ben good ter me he has an im gwine ter take keer er him â dats wat i is ez long ez i has de chance

delamere went directly to the club and soon lounged into the cardroom where several of the members were engaged in play he sauntered here and there too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice that the greetings he received were less cordial than those usually exchanged between the members of a small and select social club finally when augustus commonly and more appropriately called  gus davidson came into the room tom stepped toward him

 will you take a hand in a game gus  

dont care if i do said the other lets sit over here

davidson led the way to a table near the fireplace near which stood a tall screen which at times occupied various places in the room davidson took the seat opposite the fireplace leaving delamere with his back to the screen

delamere staked half of sandys money and lost he staked the rest and determined to win because he could not afford to lose he had just reached out his hand to gather in the stakes when he was charged with cheating at cards of which two members who had quietly entered the room and posted themselves behind the screen had secured specific proof

a meeting of the membership committee was hastily summoned it being an hour at which most of them might be found at the club to avoid a scandal and to save the feelings of a prominent family delamere was given an opportunity to resign quietly from the club on condition that he paid all his gambling debts within three days and took an oath never to play cards again for money this latter condition was made at the suggestion of an elderly member who apparently believed that a man who would cheat at cards would stick at perjury

delamere acquiesced very promptly the taking of the oath was easy the payment of some fifteen hundred dollars of debts was a different matter he went away from the club thoughtfully and it may be said in full justice to a past which was far from immaculate that in his present thoughts he touched a depth of scoundrelism far beyond anything of which he had as yet deemed himself capable when a man of good position of whom much is expected takes to evil courses his progress is apt to resemble that of a wellbred woman who has started on the downward path â the pace is all the swifter because of the distance which must be traversed to reach the bottom delamere had made rapid headway having hitherto played with sin his servant had now become his master and held him in an iron grip

having finished cleaning his clothes sandy went out to the kitchen for supper after which he found himself with nothing to do mr delameres absence relieved him from attendance at the house during the evening he might have smoked his pipe tranquilly in the kitchen until bedtime had not the cook intimated rather pointedly that she expected other company to a man of sandys tact a word was sufficient and he resigned himself to seeking companionship elsewhere

under normal circumstances sandy would have attended prayermeeting on this particular evening of the week  but being still in contumacy and cherishing what he considered the just resentment of a man falsely accused he stifled the inclination which by long habit led him toward the church and set out for the house of a friend with whom it occurred to him that he might spend the evening pleasantly unfortunately his friend proved to be not at home so sandy turned his footsteps toward the lower part of the town where the streets were well lighted and on pleasant evenings quite animated on the way he met josh green whom he had known for many years though their paths did not often cross in his loneliness sandy accepted an invitation to go with josh and have a drink â a single drink

when sandy was going home about eleven oclock three sheets in the wind such was the potent effect of the single drink and those which had followed it he was scared almost into soberness by a remarkable apparition as it seemed to sandy he saw himself hurrying along in front of himself toward the house possibly the muddled condition of sandys intellect had so affected his judgment as to vitiate any conclusion he might draw but sandy was quite sober enough to perceive that the figure ahead of him wore his best clothes and looked exactly like him but seemed to be in something more of a hurry a discrepancy which sandy at once corrected by quickening his own pace so as to maintain as nearly as possible an equal distance between himself and his double the situation was certainly an incomprehensible one and savored of the supernatural

 ef dats me gwine long in front mused sandy in vinous perplexity  den who is dis bellin here  dere ain but one er me an my hant would n leave my body tel i wuz dead ef dats me in front den i mus be my own hant an whichever one of us is de hant de yuther must be dead an don know it i don know what ter make er no sech gwineson i dont maybe it ain me after all but it certainly do look lack me

when the apparition disappeared in the house by the side door sandy stood in the yard for several minutes under the shade of an elmtree before he could make up his mind to enter the house he took courage however upon the reflection that perhaps after all it was only the bad liquor he had drunk bad liquor often made people see double

he entered the house it was dark except for a light in tom delameres room sandy tapped softly at the door

 whos there   came delameres voice in a somewhat startled tone after a momentary silence

 its me suh sandy

they both spoke softly it was the rule of the house when mr delamere had retired and though he was not at home habit held its wonted sway

just a moment sandy

sandy waited patiently in the hall until the door was opened if the room showed any signs of haste or disorder sandy was too full of his own thoughts â and other things â to notice them

 what do you want sandy asked tom

 mistuh tom asked sandy solemnly  ef i wuz in yo place an you wuz in my place an we wuz bofe in de same place whar would i be  

tom looked at sandy keenly with a touch of apprehension did sandy mean anything in particular by this enigmatical inquiry and if so what  but sandys face clearly indicated a state of mind in which consecutive thought was improbable  and after a brief glance delamere breathed more freely

 i give it up sandy he responded lightly  thats too deep for me

 scuse me mistuh tom but is you heared er seed anybody er anything come in de house fer de las ten minutes  

 why no sandy i havent heard any one i came from the club an hour ago i had forgotten my key and sally got up and let me in and then went back to bed ive been sitting here reading ever since i should have heard any one who came in

 mistuh tom inquired sandy anxiously  would you low dat id ben drinkin too much  

 no sandy i should say you were sober enough though of course you may have had a few drinks perhaps youd like another  ive got something good here

 no suh mistuh tom no suh no mo liquor fer me suh never  avhen liquor kin make a man see his own hant its bout time fer dat man ter quit drinkin it sho is  goodnight mistuh tom

as sandy turned to go delamere was struck by a sudden and daring thought the creature of impulse he acted upon it immediately

 by the way sandy he exclaimed carelessly  i can pay you back that money you were good enough to lend me this afternoon i think ill sleep better if i have the debt off my mind and i shouldnt wonder if you would you dont mind having it in gold do you  

 no indeed suh replied sandy  i ain seen no gol fer so long dat de sight er itd be good fer my eyes

tom counted out ten fivedollar gold pieces upon the table at his elbow

 and heres another sandy he said adding an eleventh  as interest for the use of it

 thank y mistuh tom i didnt spec no intrus but i don never fuse gol wen i kin git it

 and here added delamere reaching carelessly into a bureau drawer  is a little old silk purse that ive had since i was a boy ill put the gold in it sandy it will hold it very nicely

 thank y mistuh tom youre a gentleman suh an wothy er de famly name goodnight suh an i hope yo dreamsll be pleasanter n mine ef it want fer dis gol kinder takin my min offn dat hant i don spose id be able to do much sleepin ternight goodnight suh

 goodnight sandy

whether or not delamere slept soundly or was troubled by dreams pleasant or unpleasant it is nevertheless true that he locked his door and sat up an hour later looking through the drawers of his bureau and burning several articles in the little iron stove which constituted part of the bedroom furniture

it is also true that he rose very early before the household was stirring the cook slept in a room off the kitchen which was in an outhouse in the back yard she was just stretching herself preparatory to getting up when tom came to her window and said that he was going off fishing to be gone all day and that he would not wait for breakfast

ellis left the office of the morning chronicle about eleven oclock the same evening and set out to walk home his boardinghouse was only a short distance beyond old mr delameres residence and while he might have saved time and labor by a slightly shorter route he generally selected this one because it led also by major carterets house sometimes there would be a ray of light from claras room which was on one of the front corners  and at any rate he would have the pleasure of gazing at the outside of the casket that enshrined the jewel of his heart it was true that this purely sentimental pleasure was sometimes dashed with bitterness at the thought of his rival but one in love must take the bitter with the sweet and who would say that a spice of jealousy does not add a certain zest to love on this particular evening however he was in a hopeful mood at the clarendon club where he had gone a couple of hours before to verify a certain news item for the morning paper he had heard a story about tom delamere which he imagined would spike that gentlemans guns for all time so far as miss pemberton was concerned so grave an affair as cheating at cards could never be kept secret â it was certain to reach her ears  and ellis was morally certain that clara would never marry a man who had been proved dishonorable in all probability there would be no great sensation about the matter delamere was too well connected too many prominent people would be involved â even clara and the editor himself of whom delamere was a distant cousin the reputation of the club was also to be considered ellis was not the man to feel a malicious delight in the misfortunes of another nor was he a pessimist who welcomed scandal and disgrace with open arms as confirming a gloomy theory of human life but with the best intentions in the world it was no more than human nature that he should feel a certain elation in the thought that his rival had been practically disposed of and the field left clear especially since this good situation had been brought about merely by the unmasking of a hypocrite who had held him at an unfair disadvantage in the race for claras favor

the night was quiet except for the faint sound of distant music now and then or the mellow laughter of some group of revelers ellis met but few pedestrians but as he neared old mr delameres he saw two men walking in the same direction as his own on the opposite side of the street he had observed that they kept at about an equal distance apart and that the second from the stealthy manner in which he was making his way was anxious to keep the first in sight without disclosing his own presence this aroused elliss curiosity which was satisfied in some degree when the man in advance stopped beneath a lamppost and stood for a moment looking across the street with his face plainly visible in the yellow circle of light it was a dark face and ellis recognized it instantly as that of old mr delameres body servant whose personal appearance had been very vividly impressed upon ellis at the christening dinner at major carterets he had seen sandy once since too at the hotel cakewalk the negro had a small bundle in his hand the nature of which ellis could not make out

when sandy had stopped beneath the lamppost the man who was following him had dodged behind a treetrunk when sandy moved on ellis who had stopped in turn saw the man in hiding come out and follow sandy when this second man came in range of the light ellis wondered that there should be two men so much alike the first of the two had undoubtedly been sandy ellis had recognized the peculiar oldfashioned coat that sandy had worn upon the two occasions when he had noticed him barring this difference and the somewhat unsteady gait of the second man the two were as much alike as twin brothers

when they had entered mr delameres house one after the other â in the stillness of the night ellis could perceive that each of them tried to make as little noise as possible â ellis supposed that they were probably relatives both employed as servants or that some younger negro taking sandy for a model was trying to pattern himself after his superior why all this mystery of course he could not imagine unless the younger man had been out without permission and was trying to avoid the accusing eye of sandy ellis was vaguely conscious that he had seen the other negro somewhere but he could not for the moment place him â there were so many negroes nearly three negroes to one white man in the city of wellington

the subject however while curious was not important as compared with the thoughts of his sweetheart which drove it from his mind clara had been kind to him the night before â whatever her motive she had been kind and could not consistently return to her attitude of coldness with delamere hopelessly discredited ellis hoped to have at least fair play â with fair play he would take his chances of the outcome

on friday morning when old mrs ochiltrees cook dinah went to wake her mistress she was confronted with a sight that wellnigh blanched her ebony cheek and caused her eyes almost to start from her head with horror as soon as she could command her trembling limbs sufficiently to make them carry her she rushed out of the house and down the street bareheaded covering in an incredibly short time the few blocks that separated mrs ochiltrees residence from that of her niece

she hastened around the house and finding the back door open and the servants stirring ran into the house and up the stairs with the familiarity of an old servant not stopping until she reached the door of mrs carterets chamber at which she knocked in great agitation

entering in response to mrs carterets invitation she found the lady dressed in a simple wrapper superintending the morning toilet of little dodie who was a wakeful child and insisted upon rising with the birds for whose music he still showed a great fondness in spite of his narrow escape while listening to the mockingbird

 what is it dinah  asked mrs carteret alarmed at the frightened face of her aunts old servitor

 o my lawd mis livy my lawd my lawd 

my legs is trimlin so dat i cant liadly hoi ray hans stiddy nough ter say wat i got ter say o lawd have mussy on us po sinners watever is gwine ter happen in dis worl er sin an sorrer  

 what in the world is the matter dinah   demanded mrs carteret whose own excitement had increased with the length of this preamble  has anything happened to aunt polly  

 somebody done broke in de house las night mis livy an kill mis polly an lef her layin dead on de flo in her own blood wid her cedar chis broke open an evething scattered roun de flo o my lawd my lawd my lawd my lawd 

mrs carteret was shocked beyond expression perhaps the spectacle of dinahs unrestrained terror aided her to retain a greater measure of selfcontrol than she might otherwise have been capable of giving the nurse some directions in regard to the child she hastily descended the stairs and seizing a hat and jacket from the rack in the hall ran immediately with dinah to the scene of the tragedy before the thought of this violent death all her aunts faults faded into insignificance and only her good qualities were remembered she had reared olivia she had stood up for the memory of olivias mother when others had seemed to forget what was due to it to her niece she had been a second mother and had never been lacking in affection

more than one motive however lent wings to mrs carterets feet her aunts incomplete disclosures on the day of the drive past the hospital had been weighing upon mrs carterets mind and she had intended to make another effort this very day to get an answer to her question about the papers which the woman had claimed were in existence suppose her aunt had really found such papers â papers which would seem to prove the preposterous claim made by her fathers mulatto mistress  suppose that with the fatuity which generally leads human beings to keep compromising documents her aunt had preserved these papers  if they should be found there in the house there might be a scandal if nothing worse and this was to be avoided at all hazards

guided by some fortunate instinct dinah had as yet informed no one but mrs carteret of her discovery if they could reach the house before the murder became known to any third person she might be the first to secure access to the remaining contents of the cedar chest which would be likely to be held as evidence in case the officers of the law forestalled her own arrival

they found the house wrapped in the silence of death mrs carteret entered the chamber of the dead woman upon the floor where it had fallen lay the body in a pool of blood the strongly marked countenance scarcely more grim in the rigidity of death than it had been in life a gaping wound in the head accounted easily for the death the cedar chest stood open its strong fastenings having been broken by a steel bar which still lay beside it near it were scattered pieces of old lace antiquated jewelry tarnished silverware â the various mute souvenirs of the joys and sorrows of a long and active life

kneeling by the open chest mrs carteret glanced hurriedly through its contents there were no papers there except a few old deeds and letters she had risen with a sigh of relief when she perceived the end of a paper projecting from beneath the edge of a rug which had been carelessly rumpled probably by the burglar in his hasty search for plunder this paper or sealed envelope as it proved to be which evidently contained some inclosure she seized and at the sound of approaching footsteps thrust hastily into her own bosom

the sight of two agitated women rushing through the quiet streets at so early an hour in the morning had attracted attention and aroused curiosity and the story of the murder having once become known spread with the customary rapidity of bad news very soon a policeman and a little later a sheriffs officer arrived at the house and took charge of the remains to await the arrival of the coroner

by nine oclock a coroners jury had been summoned who after brief deliberation returned a verdict of willful murder at the hands of some person or persons unknown while engaged in the commission of a burglary

no sooner was the verdict announced than the community or at least the white third of it resolved itself spontaneously into a committee of the whole to discover the perpetrator of this dastardly crime which at this stage of the affair seemed merely one of robbery and murder

suspicion was at once directed toward the negroes as it always is when an unexplained crime is committed in a southern community the suspicion was not entirely an illogical one having been for generations trained up to thriftlessness theft and immorality against which only thirty years of very limited opportunity can be offset during which brief period they have been denied in large measure the healthful social stimulus and sympathy which holds most men in the path of rectitude colored people might reasonably be expected to commit at least a share of crime proportionate to their numbers the population of the town was at least two thirds colored the chances were therefore in the absence of evidence at least two to one that a man of color had committed the crime the southern tendency to charge the negroes with all the crime and immorality of that region unjust and exaggerated as the claim may be was therefore not without a logical basis to the extent above indicated

it must not be imagined that any logic was needed or any reasoning consciously worked out the mere suggestion that the crime had been committed by a negro was equivalent to proof against any negro that might be suspected and could not prove his innocence a committee of white men was hastily formed acting independently of the police force which was practically ignored as likely to favor the negroes this committee set to work to discover the murderer

the spontaneous activity of the whites was accompanied by a visible shrinkage of the colored population this could not be taken as any indication of guilt but was merely a recognition of the palpable fact that the american habit of lynching had so whetted the thirst for black blood that a negro suspected of crime had to face at least the possibility of a short shrift and a long rope not to mention more gruesome horrors without the intervention of judge or jury since to have a black face at such a time was to challenge suspicion and since there was neither the martyrs glory nor the saints renown in being killed for some one elses crime and very little hope of successful resistance in case of an attempt at lynching it was obviously the part of prudence for those thus marked to seek immunity in a temporary disappearance from public view

about ten oclock on the morning of the discovery of the murder captain mc bane and general belmont as though moved by a common impulse found themselves at the office of the morning chronicle carteret was expecting them though there had been no appointment made these three resourceful and energetic minds representing no organized body and clothed with no legal authority had so completely arrogated to themselves the leadership of white public sentiment as to come together instinctively when an event happened which concerned the public and as this murder presumably did involved the matter of race

 well gentlemen demanded mc bane impatiently  what are we going to do with the scoundrel when we catch him  

 theyve got the murderer announced a reporter entering the room

 who is he   they demanded in a breath

 a nigger by the name of sandy campbell a servant of old mr delamere

 how did they catch him  

 our jerry saw him last night going toward mrs ochiltrees house and a white man saw him coming away half an hour later

 has he confessed  

 no but he might as well when the posse went to arrest him they found him cleaning the clothes he had worn last night and discovered in his room a part of the plunder he denies it strenuously but it seems a clear case

 there can be no doubt said ellis who had come into the room behind the reporter  i saw the negro last night at twelve oclock going into mr delameres yard with a bundle in his hand

 he is the last negro i should have suspected said carteret  mr delamere had implicit confidence in him

 all niggers are alike remarked mc bane sententiously  the only way to keep them from stealing is not to give them the chance a nigger will steal a cent off a dead mans eye he has assaulted and murdered a white woman â an example should be made of him

carteret recalled very distinctly the presence of this negro at his own residence on the occasion of little theodores christening dinner he remembered having questioned the prudence of letting a servant know that mrs ochiltree kept money in the house mr delamere had insisted strenuously upon the honesty of this particular negro the whole race in the majors opinion was morally undeveloped and only held within bounds by the restraining influence of the white people under mr delameres thumb this sandy had been a model servant â faithful docile respectful and selfrespecting but mr delamere had grown old and had probably lost in a measure his moral influence over his servant left to his own degraded ancestral instincts sandy had begun to deteriorate and a rapid decline had culminated in this robbery and murder â and who knew what other horror  the criminal was a negro the victim a white woman â it was only reasonable to expect the worst

 hell swing for it observed the general

ellis went into another room where his duty called him

 he should burn for it averred mc bane  i say burn the nigger

 this said carteret  is something more than an ordinary crime to be dealt with by the ordinary processes of law it is a murderous and fatal assault upon a woman of our race â upon our race in the person of its womanhood its crown and flower if such crimes are not punished with swift and terrible directness the whole white womanhood of the south is in danger

 burn the nigger repeated mc bane automatically

 neither is this a mere sporadic crime carteret went on  it is symptomatic it is the logical and inevitable result of the conditions which have prevailed in this town for the past year it is the last straw

burn the nigger reiterated mc bane we seem to have the right nigger but whether we have or not burn a nigger it is an assault upon the white race in the person of old mrs ochiltree committed by the black race in the person of some nigger it would justify the white people in burning any nigger the example would be all the more powerful if we got the wrong one it would serve notice on the niggers that we shall hold the whole race responsible for the misdeeds of each individual

 in ancient borne said the general  when a master was killed by a slave all bis slaves were put to the sword

 we couldnt afford that before the war said mc bane  but the niggers dont belong to anybody now and theres nothing to prevent our doing as we please with them a dead nigger is no loss to any white man i say burn the nigger

 i do not believe said carteret who had gone to the window and was looking out â  i do not believe that we need trouble ourselves personally about his punishment i should judge from the commotion in the street that the public will take the matter into its own hands i for one would prefer that any violence however justifiable should take place without my active intervention

 it wont take place without mine if i know it exclaimed mc bane starting for the door

 hold on a minute captain exclaimed carteret  theres more at stake in this matter than the life of a black scoundrel wellington is in the hands of negroes and scalawags what better time to rescue it

 its a trifle premature replied the general  i should have preferred to have this take place if it was to happen say three months hence on the eve of the electionâ but discussion always provokes thirst with me  i wonder if i could get jerry to bring us some drinks  

carteret summoned the porter jerrys usual manner had taken on an element of selfimportance resulting in what one might describe as a sort of condescending obsequiousness though still a porter he was also a hero and wore his aureole

 jerry said the general kindly  the white people are very much pleased with the assistance you have given them in apprehending this scoundrel campbell you have rendered a great public service jerry and we wish you to know that it is appreciated

 thank y ginl thank y suh  i alluz tries ter do iny dntj suh an stan by dem dat stans by me dat lowdown nigger oughter be lynch suh dont you think er ese bunt  dere ain nothin too bad ter happen ter im

 no doubt he will be punished as he deserves jerry returned the general  and we will see that you are suitably rewarded go across the street and get me three calhoun cocktails i seem to have nothing less than a twodollar bill but you may keep the change jerry â all the change

jerry was very happy he had distinguished himself in the public view for to jerry as to the white people themselves the white people were the public he had won the goodwill of the best people and had already begun to reap a tangible reward it is true that several strange white men looked at him with lowering brows as he crossed the street which was curiously empty of colored people but he nevertheless went firmly forward panoplied in the consciousness of his own rectitude and serenely confident of the protection of the major and the majors friends

jerry is about the only negro i have seen since nine oclock observed the general when the porter had gone  if this were election day where would the negro vote be

 in hiding where most of the negro population is today answered mc bane  its a pity if old mrs ochiltree had to go this way that it couldnt have been deferred a month or six weeks

carteret frowned at this remark which coming from mc bane seemed lacking in human feeling as well as in respect to his wifes dead relative

but resumed the general if this negro is lynched as he well deserves to be it will not be without its effect we still have in reserve for the election a weapon which this affair will only render more effective what became of the piece in the negro paper  

 i have it here answered carteret  i was just about to use it as the text for an editorial

 save it awhile longer responded the general this crime itself will give you text enough for a fourvolume work

when this conference ended carteret immediately put into press an extra edition of the morning chronicle which was soon upon the streets giving details of the crime which was characterized as an atrocious assault upon a defenseless old lady whose age and sex would have protected her from harm at the hands of any one but a brute in the lowest human form this event the chronicle suggested had only confirmed the opinion which had been of late growing upon the white people that drastic efforts were necessary to protect the white women of the south against brutal lascivious and murderous assaults at the hands of negro men it was only another significant example of the results which might have been foreseen from the application of a false and pernicious political theory by which ignorance clothed in a little brief authority was sought to be exalted over knowledge vice over virtue an inferior and degraded race above the heavencrowned anglosaxon if an outraged people justly infuriated and impatient of the slow processes of the courts should assert their inherent sovereignty which the law after all was merely intended to embody and should choose in obedience to the higher law to set aside temporarily the ordinary judicial procedure it would serve as a warning and an example to the vicious elements of the community of the swift and terrible punishment which would fall like the judgment of god upon any one who laid sacrilegious hands upon white womanhood

dr miller who had sat up late the night before with a difficult case at the hospital was roused about eleven oclock from a deep and dreamless sleep struggling back into consciousness he was informed by his wife who stood by his bedside that mr watson the colored lawyer wished to see him upon a matter of great importance

nothing but a matter of life and death would make me get up just now he said with a portentous yawn

 this is a matter of life and death replied janet  old mrs polly ochiltree was robbed and murdered last night and sandy campbell has been arrested for the crime â and they are going to lynch him 

 tell watson to come right up exclaimed miller springing out of bed we can talk while im dressing

while miller made a hasty toilet watson explained the situation campbell had been arrested on the charge of murder he had been seen during the night in the neighborhood of the scene of the crime by two different persons a negro and a white man and had been identified later while entering mr delameres house where he lived and where damning proofs of his guilt had been discovered the most important item of which was an oldfashioned knit silk purse recognized as mrs ochiltrees and several gold pieces of early coinage of which the murdered woman was known to have a number watson brought with him one of the first copies procurable of the extra edition of the chronicle which contained these facts and further information

they were still talking when mrs miller knocking at the door announced that big josh green wished to see the doctor about sandy campbell miller took his collar and necktie in his hand and went downstairs where josh sat waiting

 doctuh said green  de wite folks is talkin borut lynchin sandy campbell fer killin ole mis ochiltree he never done it an dey ought n ter be lowed ter lynch im

 they ought not to lynch him even if he committed the crime returned miller  but still less if he didnt what do you know about it

 i know he was wid me suh las night at de time when dey say ole mis ochiltree wuz killed we wuz down ter sam taylors place havin a little game of kyards an a little liquor den we lef dere an went up ez fur ez de corner er main an vine streets where we pated an sandy went long tods home moover dey say he had on check britches an a blue coat when sandy wuz wid me he had on gray clos an when we seprated he want in no shape ter be changin his clos let lone robbin er killin anybody

 your testimony ought to prove an alibi for him declared miller

 dere ain gwine ter be no chance ter prove nothin lessn we kin do it mighty quick dey say deyre gwine ter lynch im ternight â some on em is talkin bout burnin im my idee is ter hunt up de niggers an git em ter stan tergether an gyard de jail

 why shouldnt we go to the principal white people of the town and tell them joshs story and appeal to them to stop this thing until campbell can have a hearing  

 it wouldnt do any good said watson despondently   their blood is up it seems that some colored man attacked mrs ochiltree â and he was a murderous villain whoever he may be to quote josh would destroy the effect of his story â we know he never harmed any one but himself  â  an a few keerliss people wat got in my way corrected josh

 he has been in court several times for fighting â and thats against him to have been at sam taylors place is against sandy too rather than in his favor no josh the white people wwld believe that you were trying to shield sandy and you would probably be arrested as an accomplice

 but look ahere mr watson â dr miller is weall jes got ter set down here widout openin ou mouths an let dese wite folks hang er bun a man wat we know ain guilty  dat aint no law ner jestice ner nothin ef youall wont hep ill do somethin mysef  deres two niggers ter one white man in dis town an im sho i kin fin fifty of em watll fight ef dey kin fin anybody ter lead em now hold on josh argued miller what is to be gained by fighting  suppose you got your crowd together and surrounded the jail â what then 

 thered be a clash declared watson  and instead of one dead negro thered be fifty the white people are claiming now that campbell didnt stop with robbery and murder a special edition of the morning chronicle just out suggests a further purpose and has all the old shopworn cant about race purity and supremacy and imperative necessity which always comes to the front whenever it is sought to justify some outrage on the colored folks the blood of the whites is up i tell you  

 is there anything to that suggestion   asked miller incredulously

 it doesnt matter whether there is or not returned watson merely to suggest it proves it nothing was said about this feature until the paper came out â and even its statement is vague and indefinite â but now the claim is in every mouth i met only black looks as i came down the street white men with whom i have long been on friendly terms passed me without a word a negro has been arrested on suspicion â the entire race is condemned on general principles

 the whole thing is profoundly discouraging said miller sadly  try as we may to build up the race in the essentials of good citizenship and win the good opinion of the best people some black scoundrel comes along and by a single criminal act committed in the twinkling of an eye neutralizes the effect of a whole years work

 its mighty easy neutalize er whatever you call it said josh sullenly  de wite folks don want too good an opinion er de niggers â ef dey had a good opinion of em dey would n have no excuse fer busin an hangin an burnin em but ef dey cant keep from doin it let em git de right man  dis way er pickin up de fus nigger dey comes across an stringin im up regadliss ought ter be stop an stop right now 

 yes thats the worst of lynch law said watson  but we are wasting valuable time â its hardly worth while for us to discuss a subject we are all agreed upon one of our race accused of certain acts is about to be put to death without judge or jury ostensibly because he committed a crime â really because he is a negro for if he were white he would not be lynched it is thus made a race issue on the one side as well as on the other what can we do to protect him  

 we kin fight ef we haf ter replied josh resolutely

well now let us see suppose the colored people armed themselves messages would at once be sent to every town and county in the neighborhood white men from all over the state armed to the teeth would at the slightest word pour into town on every railroad train and extras would be run for their benefit

 theyre already coming in said watson

 we might go to the sheriff suggested miller  and demand that he telegraph the governor to call out the militia

 i spoke to the sheriff an hour ago replied watson  he has a white face and a whiter liver he does not dare call out the militia to protect a negro charged with such a brutal crime  â and if he did the militia are white men and who can say that their efforts would not be directed to keeping the negroes out of the way in order that the white devils might do their worst  the whole machinery of the state is in the hands of white men elected partly by our votes when the color line is drawn if they choose to stand together with the rest of their race against us or to remain passive and let the others work their will we are helpless â our cause is hopeless

 we might call on the general government said miller  surely the president would intervene

 such a demand would be of no avail returned watson  the government can only intervene under certain conditions of which it must be informed through designated channels it never sees anything that is not officially called to its attention the whole negro population of the south might be slaughtered before the necessary red tape could be spun out to inform the president that a state of anarchy prevailed theres no hope there

 den wat we gwine ter do demanded josh indignantly   jes set here an let em hang sandy er bun im 

 god knows   exclaimed miller  the outlook is dark but we should at least try to do something there must be some white men in the town who would stand for law and order â theres no possible chance for sandy to escape hanging by due process of law if he is guilty we might at least try half a dozen gentlemen

wed better leave josh here said watson  hes too truculent if he went on the street hed make trouble and if he accompanied us hed do more harm than good wait for us here josh until weve seen what we can do well be back in half an hour

in half an hour they had both returned

its no use reported watson gloomily i called at the mayors office and found it locked he is doubtless afraid on his own account and would not dream of asserting his authority i then looked up judge everton who has always seemed to be fair my reception was cold he admitted that lynching was as a rule unjustifiable but maintained that there were exceptions to all rules â that laws were made after all to express the will of the people in regard to the ordinary administration of justice but that in an emergency the sovereign people might assert itself and take the law into its own hands â the creature was not greater than the creator he laughed at my suggestion that sandy was innocent  if he is innocent he said  then produce the real criminal you negroes are standing in your own light when you try to protect such dastardly scoundrels as this campbell who is an enemy of society and not fit to live i shall not move in the matter if a negro wants the protection of the law let him obey the law a wise judge â a second daniel come to judgment if this were the law there would be no need of judges or juries

 i called on dr price said miller  my good friend dr price who would rather lie than hurt my feelings  miller he declared  this is no affair of mine or yours i have too much respect for myself and my profession to interfere in such a matter and you will accomplish nothing and only lessen your own influence by having anything to say  but the man may be innocent i replied   there is every reason to believe that he is he shook his head pityingly you are selfdeceived miller your prejudice has warped your judgment the proof is overwhelming that he robbed this old lady laid violent hands upon her and left her dead if he did no more he has violated the written and unwritten law of the southern states i could not save him if i would miller and frankly i would not if i could if he is innocent his people can console themselves with the reflection that mrs ochiltree was also innocent and balance one crime against the other the white against the black of course i shall take no part in whatever may be done â but it is not my affair nor yours take my advice miller and keep out of it  that is the situation added miller summing up  their friendship for us a slender stream at the best dries up entirely when it strikes their prejudices there is seemingly not one white man in wellington who will speak a word for law order decency or humanity those who do not participate will stand idly by and see an untried man deliberately and brutally murdered race prejudice is the devil unchained

 well den suh said josh  where does wre stan now  wat is we gwine ter do  i would n min fightin fer my time aint come yit â i feels dat in my bones wat we gwine ter do dats wat i wanter know

 what does old mr delamere have to say about the matter  asked miller suddenly  why havent we thought of him before  has he been seen   no replied watson gloomily and for a good reason â he is not in town i came by the house just now and learned that he went out to his country place yesterday afternoon to remain a week sandy was to have followed him out there this morning â its a pity he didnt go yesterday the old gentleman has probably heard nothing about the matter

 how about young delamere  

 he went away early this morning down the river to fish hell probably not hear of it before night and hes only a boy anyway and could very likely do nothing said watson

miller looked at his watch

 belleview is ten miles away he said  it is now eleven oclock i can drive out there in an hour and a half at the farthest ill go and see mr delamere â he can do more than any living man if he is able to do anything at all theres never been a lynching here and one good white man if be choose may stem the flood long enough to give justice a chance keep track of the white people while im gone watson  and you josh learn what the colored folks are saying and do nothing rash until i return in the meantime do all that you can to find out who did commit this most atrocious murder

miller did not reach his destination without interruption at one point a considerable stretch of the road was under repair which made it necessary for him to travel slowly his horse cast a shoe and threatened to go lame but in the course of time he arrived at the entrance gate of belleview entering which he struck into a private road bordered by massive oaks whose multitudinous branches hung with long streamers of trailing moss formed for much of the way a thick canopy above his head it took him only a few minutes to traverse the quarter of a mile that lay between the entrance gate and the house itself

this old colonial plantation rich in legendary lore and replete with historic distinction had been in the delamere family for nearly two hundred years along the bank of the river which skirted its domain the famous pirate blackbeard had held high carnival and was reputed to have buried much treasure vague traditions of which still lingered among the negroes and poorwhites of the country roundabout the beautiful residence rising white and stately in a grove of ancient oaks dated from  and was built of brick which had been brought from england enlarged and improved from generation to generation it stood like a baronial castle upon a slight eminence from which could be surveyed the large demesne still belonging to the estate which had shrunk greatly from its colonial dimensions while still embracing several thousand acres part forest and part cleared land it had not of late years been profitable in spite of which mr delamere with the conservatism of his age and caste had never been able to make up his mind to part with any considerable portion of it his grandson he imagined could make the estate pay and yet preserve it in its integrity here in pleasant weather surrounded by the scenes which he loved old mr delamere spent much of the time during his declining years

dr miller had once passed a day at belleview upon mr delameres invitation for this oldfashioned gentleman whose ideals not even slavery had been able to spoil regarded himself as a trustee for the great public which ought in his opinion to take as much pride as he in the contemplation of this historic landmark in earlier years mr delamere had been a practicing lawyer and had numbered millers father among his clients he had always been regarded as friendly to the colored people and until age and ill health had driven him from active life had taken a lively interest in their advancement since the abolition of slavery upon the public opening of millers new hospital he had made an effort to be present and had made a little speech of approval and encouragement which had manifested his kindliness and given miller much pleasure

it was with the consciousness therefore that he was approaching a friend as well as sandys master that millers mind was chiefly occupied as his tired horse scenting the end of his efforts bore him with a final burst of speed along the last few rods of the journey for the urgency of millers errand involving as it did the issues of life and death did not permit him to enjoy the charm of mossy oak or forest reaches or even to appreciate the noble front of belleview house when it at last loomed up before him

well william said mr delamere as he gave his hand to miller from the armchair in which he was seated under the broad and stately portico  i didnt expect to see you out here youll excuse my not rising â im none too firm on my legs did you see anything of my man sandy back there on the road  he ought to have been here by nine oclock and its now one sandy is punctuality itself and i dont know how to account for his delay

clearly there need be no time wasted in preliminaries mr delamere had gone directly to the subject in hand

 he will not be here today sir replied miller  i have come to you on his account

in a few words miller stated the situation

 preposterous   exclaimed the old gentleman with more vigor than miller had supposed him to possess  sandy is absolutely incapable of such a crime as robbery to say nothing of murder and as for the rest that is absurd upon the face of it and so the poor old woman is dead well well well she could not have lived much longer anyway  but sandy did not kill her â its simply impossible why i raised that boy  he was born on my place id as soon believe such a thing of my own grandson as of sandy  no negro raised by a delamere would ever commit such a crime i really believe william that sandy has the family honor of the delameres quite as much at heart as i have just tell them i say sandy is innocent and it will he all right

 im afraid sir rejoined miller who kept his voice up so that the old gentleman could understand without having it suggested that miller knew he was hard of hearing  that you dont quite appreciate the situation i believe sandy innocent you believe him innocent but there are suspicious circumstances which do not explain themselves and the white people of the city believe him guilty and are going to lynch him before he has a chance to clear himself

 why doesnt he explain the suspicious circumstances   asked mr delamere  sandy is truthful and can be believed i would take sandys word as quickly as another mans oath

 he has no chance to explain said miller  the case is prejudged a crime has been committed sandy is charged with it he is black and therefore he is guilty no colored lawyer would be allowed in the jail if one should dare to go there no white lawyer will intervene hell be lynched tonight without judge jury or preacher unless we can stave the thing off for a day or two

 have you seen my grandson   asked the old gentleman  is he not looking after sandy  

 no sir it seems he went down the river this morning to fish before the murder was discovered  no one knows just where he has gone or at what hour he will return

well then said mr delamere rising from his chair with surprising vigor  i shall have to go myself no faithful servant of mine shall be hanged for a crime he didnt commit so long as i have a voice to speak or a dollar to spend therell be no trouble after i get there william the people are naturally wrought up at such a crime a fine old woman â she had some detestable traits and i was always afraid she wanted to marry me but she was of an excellent family and had many good points â an old woman of one of the best families struck down by the hand of a murderer you must remember william that blood is thicker than water and that the provocation is extreme and that a few hotheads might easily lose sight of the great principles involved and seek immediate vengeance without too much discrimination but they are good people william and when i have spoken and they have an opportunity for the sober second thought they will do nothing rashly but will wait for the operation of the law which will of course clear sandy

 im sure i hope so returned miller  shall i try to drive you back sir or will you order your own carriage  

 my horses are fresher william and ill have them brought around you can take the reins if you will â im rather old to drive â and my man will come behind with your buggy

in a few minutes they set out along the sandy road having two fresh horses they made better headway than miller had made coming out and reached wellington easily by three oclock

 i think william said mr delamere as they drove into the town  that i had first better talk with sandy he may be able to explain away the things that seem to connect him with this atrocious affair and that will put me in a better position to talk to other people about it

miller drove directly to the county jail thirty or forty white men who seemed to be casually gathered near the door closed up when the carriage approached the sheriff who had seen them from the inside came to the outer door and spoke to the visitor through a grated wicket

mr wemyss said mr delamere when he had made his way to the entrance with the aid of his cane  i wish to see my servant sandy campbell who is said to be in your custody

the sheriff hesitated meantime there was some parleying in low tones among the crowd outside no one interfered however and in a moment the door opened sufficiently to give entrance to the old gentleman after which it closed quickly and clangorously behind him

feeling no desire to linger in the locality miller having seen his companion enter the jail drove the carriage round to mr delameres house and leaving it in charge of a servant with instructions to return for his master in a quarter of an hour hastened to his own home to meet watson and josh and report the result of his efforts

the iron bolt rattled in the lock the door of a cell swung open and when mr delamere had entered was quickly closed again

 well sandy  

 oh mars john  is you fell from hebben ter liep me out er here  i prayed de lawd ter sen you an he answered my prayer an here you is mars john â here you is oh mars john git me out er dis place 

 tut tut sandy  answered his master  of course ill get you out thats what ive come for how in the world did such a mistake ever happen you would no more commit such a crime than i would 

no suh deed i would n an you know i would n i would n want ter bring no disgrace on de famly dat raise me ner ter make no trouble fer you suh but here i is suh lock up in jail an folks talkin bout hangin me fer somethin dat never entered my min suh i swea ter god i never thought er sech a thing 

 of course you didnt sandy returned mr delamere soothingly  and now the next thing and the simplest thing is to get you out of this ill speak to the officers and at the preliminary hearing tomorrow ill tell them all about you and they will let you go you wont mind spending one night in jail for your sins

 no sub ef i wuz sho id be lowed ter spen it here but dey say deyre gwine ter lynch me ternight âi kin hear em talkin fm de winders er de cell suh

well i say sandy that they shall do no such thing lynch a man brought up by a delamere for a crime of which he is innocent preposterous ill speak to the authorities and see that you are properly protected until this mystery is unraveled if tom had been here he would have had you out before now sandy my grandson is a genuine delamere is he not sandy  

 yas suh yas suh returned sandy with a lack of enthusiasm which he tried to conceal from his master  an i spose ef he had n gone fishin so soon dis mawnin hed a ben lookin after me suh

 it has been my love for him and your care of me sandy said the old gentleman tremulously  that have kept me alive so long but now explain to me everything concerning this distressing matter and i shall then be able to state your case to better advantage

well suh returned sandy i moughts well tell de whole tale an not hoi nothin back i wuz kind er lonesome las night an sence i ben tuned outen de chuch on account er dat cakewalk i did n go ter so hep me god  i did n feel like gwine ter prayermeetin so i went roun ter see solomon williams an he want home an den i walk down street an met josh green an he ax me inter sam taylors place an i sot roun dere wid josh till bout leven oclock wen i stated back home i went straight ter tie house suh an went ter bed an ter sleep widout sayin a wod ter a single soul excep mistuh tom who wuz settin up readin a book wen i come in i wish i may drap dead in my tracks suh ef dat aint de gods truf suh evey wod of it 

 i believe every word of it sandy now tell me about the clothes that you are said to have been found cleaning and the suspicious articles that were found in your room  

 dats wat beats me mars john replied sandy shaking his head mournfully  wen i lef home las night after supper my clos wuz all put erway in de closet in my room folded up on de shef ter keep de moths out dey wuz my good clos â de blue coat dat you wo ter de weddin foty years ago an dem dere plaid pants i gun mistuh cohen fo dollars fer three years ago an wen i looked in my closet dis mawnin suh befo i got ready ter stat fer belleview dere wuz my clos layin on de flo all muddy an crumple up des lack somebody had wo em in a fight somebody ese had wo my clos â er ese dered ben some witchcraf er some sort er devilment gwine on dat i cant make out suh ter save my soul 

 there was no witchcraft sandy but that there was some deviltry might well be now what other negro who might have been mistaken for you could have taken your clothes surely no one about the house  

no suh no suh it couldnt a ben jeff fer he wuz at belleview wid you  an it couldnt a ben billy fer he wuz too little ter wear my clos an it couldnt a ben sally fer shes a oman its a mystry ter me suh  

 have you no enenaies  is there any one in wellington whom you imagine would like to do you an injury  

 not a livin soul dat i knows of suh ive ben tuned outn de chuch but i don know who my enemy is dere er ef it wuz all a mistake like dis yer jailin is but de debbil is in dis somewhar mars johnâ an i got my reasons fer sayin so

 what do you mean sandy  

sandy related his experience of the preceding evening  how he had seen the apparition preceding him to the house and how he had questioned tom upon the subject

 there s some mystery here sandy said mr delamere reflectively  have you told me all now upon your honor i am trying to save your life sandy and i must be able to trust your word implicitly you must tell me every circumstance a very little and seemingly unimportant bit of evidence may sometimes determine the issue of a great lawsuit there is one thing especially sandy  where did you get the gold which was found in your trunk  

sandys face lit up with hopefulness

 why mars john i kin splain dat part easy hat wuz money i had lent out an i got back fm â but no suh i promise not ter tell

 circumstances absolve you from your promise sandy your life is of more value to you than any other thing if you will explain where you got the gold and the silk purse that contained it which is said to be mrs ochiltrees you will be back home before night

old mr delameres faculties which had been waning somewhat in sympathy with his health were stirred to unusual acuteness by his servants danger he was watching sandy with all the awakened instincts of the trial lawyer he could see clearly enough that in beginning to account for the possession of the gold sandy had started off with his explanation in all sincerity at the mention of the silk purse however his face had blanched to an ashen gray and the words had frozen upon his lips

a less discerning observer might have taken these things as signs of guilt but not so mr delamere

 well sandy said his master encouragingly  go on you got the gold from  â sandy remained silent he had had a great shock and had taken a great resolution

mars john he asked dreamily you don blieve dat i done dis thing  

 certainly not sandy else why should i be here    an nothin would n make you blieve it suh  

 no sandy â i could not believe it of you ive known you too long and too well

 an you would n blieve it not even ef i would n say one wod mo about it  

no sandy i believe you no more capable of this crime than i would be â or my grandson tom i wish tom were here that he might help me overcome your stubbornness  but youll not be so foolish so absurdly foolish sandy as to keep silent and risk your life merely to shield some one else when by speaking you might clear up this mystery and be restored at once to liberty just tell me where you got the gold added the old gentleman persuasively  come now sandy thats a good fellow  

mars john asked sandy softly  wen my daddy way back yander befo de wah wuz about ter be sol away fm his wife an childen you bought him an dem an kep us all on yo place tergether didnt you suh  

 yes sandy and he was a faithful servant and proved worthy of all i did for him

 and wen he had woked fer you ten years suh you sot im free  

 yes sandy he had earned his freedom

 an wen de wah broke out an my folks wuz scattered an i did n have nothin ter do ner nowhar ter go you kep me on yo place and tuck me ter wait on you suh didnt you  

yes sandy and you have been a good servant and a good friend but tell me now about this gold and ill go and get you out of this right away for i need you sandy and youll not be of any use to me shut up here 

 jes hoi on a minute befo you go mars john fer ef dem people outside should git holt er me befo you does git me out er here i may never see you no mo suh in dis worl wen mars billy mc lean shot me by mistake wile we wuz out huntin dat day who wuz it boun up my wouns an kep me from bleedin ter def an kyared me two miles on his own shoulders ter a doctuh  

yes sandy and when black sally ran away with your young mistress and tom when tom was a baby who stopped the runaway and saved their lives at the risk of his own  

 dat want nothin suh anybody could a done dat wat wuz strong ernuff an swif ernuff you is ben good ter me suh all dese years an ive tried ter do my duty by you suh an by mistuh tom who wuz yo own granson an de las one er de famly

 yes you have sandy and when i am gone which will not be very long tom will take care of you and see that you never want but we are wasting valuable time sandy in these old reminiscences let us get back to the present tell me about the gold now so that i may at once look after your safety it may not even be necessary for you to remain here all night

 jes one wod mo mars john befo you go i know youre gwine ter do de bes you kin fer me an im sorry i cant hep you no mo wid it but ef dere should be any accident er ef you cant git me out er here don bother yo min bout it no mo suh an don git yosef ixcited fer you know de doctuh says suh dat you cant stan ixcitement but jes leave me in de bans er de lawd suh â hell look after me here er hereafter i know ive fell fm grace mo dn once but ive done made my peace wid him in dis here jailhouse suh an i aint feared ter die â ef i haf ter i ain got no wife ner childn ter mon fer me an ill die knowin dat ive done my duty ter dem dat hied me an trusted me an had claims on me fer i wuz raise by a delamere suh an all de ole delameres wuz gentemen an deir principles spread ter de niggers round em suh  an ef i has ter die fer somethin i did n do â i kin die suh like a genteman but ez fer dat gol suh i ain gwine ter say one wod mo bout it ter nobody in dis worl 

nothing could shake sandys determination mr delamere argued expostulated but all in vain sandy would not speak

more and more confident of some mystery which would come out in time if properly investigated mr

delamere strangely beset by a vague sense of discomfort over and beyond that occasioned by his servants danger hurried away upon his errand of mercy he felt less confident of the outcome than when he had entered the jail but was quite as much resolved that no effort should be spared to secure protection for sandy until there had been full opportunity for the truth to become known

 take good care of your prisoner sheriff he said sternly as he was conducted to the door  he will not be long in your custody and i shall see that you are held strictly accountable for his safety

 ill do what i can sir replied the sheriff in an even tone and seemingly not greatly impressed by this warning  if the prisoner is taken from me it will be because the force that comes for him is too strong for resistance

 there should be no force too strong for an honest man in your position to resist â whether successfully or not is beyond the question the officer who is intimidated by threats or by his own fears is recreant to his duty and no better than the mob which threatens him but you will have no such test mr wemyss i shall see to it myself that there is no violence 

mr delameres coachman who in accordance with instructions left by miller had brought the carriage around to the jail and was waiting anxiously at the nearest corner drove up with some trepidation as he saw his master emerge from the prison the old gentleman entered the carriage and gave the order to be driven to the office of the morning chronicle according to jerry the porter whom he encountered at the door carteret was in his office and mr delamere with the aid of his servant climbed the stairs painfully and found the editor at his desk

 carteret exclaimed mr delamere what is all this talk about lynching my man for murder and robbery and criminal assault  its perfectly absurd  the man was raised by me  he has lived in my house forty years he has been honest faithful and trustworthy he would no more be capable of this crime than you would or my grandson tom sandy has too much respect for the family to do anything that would reflect disgrace upon it

 my dear mr delamere asked carteret with an indulgent smile  how could a negro possibly reflect discredit upon a white family  i should really like to know

 how sir  a white family raised him like all the negroes he has been clay in the hands of the white people they are what we have made them or permitted them to become

 we are not god mr delamere we do not claim to have created these â masterpieces

 no  but we thought to overrule gods laws and we enslaved these people for our greed and sought to escape the manstealers curse by laying to our souls the flattering unction that we were making of barbarous negroes civilized and christian men if we did not if instead of making them christians we have made some of them brutes we have only ourselves to blame and if these prey upon society it is our just punishment but my negroes carteret were well raised and well behaved this man is innocent of this offense i solemnly affirm and i want your aid to secure his safety until a fair trial can be had

 on your bare word sir   asked carteret not at all moved by this outburst

old mr delamere trembled with anger and his withered cheek flushed darkly but he restrained his feelings and answered with an attempt at calmness  â  time was sir when the word of a delamere was held as good as his bond and those who questioned it were forced to maintain their skepticism upon the field of honor time was sir when the law was enforced in this state in a manner to command the respect of the world our lawyers our judges our courts were a credit to humanity and civilization i fear i have outlasted my epoch â i have lived to hear of white men the most favored of races the heirs of civilization the conservators of liberty howling like red indians around a human being slowly roasting at the stake

my dear sir said carteret soothingly you should undeceive yourself this man is no longer your property the negroes are no longer under our control and with their emancipation ceased our responsibility their insolence and disregard for law have reached a point where they must be sternly rebuked  the law retorted mr delamere  furnishes a sufficient penalty for any crime however heinous and our code is by no means lenient to my oldfashioned notions death would seem an adequate punishment for any crime and torture has been abolished in civilized countries for a hundred years it would be better to let a crime go entirely unpunished than to use it as a pretext for turning the whole white population into a mob of primitive savages dancing in hellish glee around the mangled body of a man who has never been tried for a crime all this however is apart from my errand which is to secure your assistance in heading off this mob until sandy can have a fair hearing and an opportunity to prove his innocence

 how can i do that mr delamere 

you are editor of the morning chronicle the chronicle is the leading newspaper of the city this mornings issue practically suggested the mob the same means will stop it i will pay the expense of an extra edition calling off the mob on the ground that newly discovered evidence has shown the prisoners innocence

 but where is the evidence   asked carteret again mr delamere flushed and trembled  my evidence sir  i say the negro was morally incapable of the crime a man of fortyfive does not change his nature overnight he is no more capable of a disgraceful deed than my grandson would be 

carteret smiled sadly

 i am sorry mr delamere he said  that yon should permit yourself to be so exercised about a worthless scoundrel who has forfeited his right to live the proof against him is overwhelming as to his capability of crime we will apply your own test you have been kept in the dark too long mr delamere â indeed we all have â about others as well as this negro listen sir last night at the clarendon club tom delamere was caught cheating outrageously at cards he had been suspected for some time a trap was laid for him and he fell into it out of regard for you and for my family he has been permitted to resign quietly with the understanding that he first pay off his debts which are considerable

mr delameres face which had taken on some color in the excitement of the interview had gradually paled to a chalky white while carteret was speaking his head sunk forward already an old man he seemed to have aged ten years in but little more than as many seconds

 can this be true   he demanded in a hoarse whisper  is it â entirely authentic  

 true as gospel true as it is that mrs ochiltree has been murdered and that this negro killed her ellis was at the club a few minutes after the affair happened and learned the facts from one of the participants tom made no attempt at denial we have kept the matter out of the other papers and i would have spared your feelings â i surely would not wish to wround them â but the temptation proved too strong for me and it seemed the only way to convince you  it was your own test if a gentleman of a distinguished name and an honorable ancestry with all the restraining forces of social position surrounding him to hold him in check can stoop to dishonor what is the improbability of an illiterate negros being at least capable of crime

 enough sir said the old gentleman  you have proved enough my grandson may be a scoundrelâ i can see in the light of this revelation how he might be  and he seems not to have denied it i maintain nevertheless that my man sandy is innocent of the charge against him he has denied it and it has not been proved carteret i owe that negro my life  he and his father before him have served me and mine faithfully and well i cannot see him killed like a dog without judge or jury â no not even if he were guilty which i do not believe 

carteret felt a twinge of remorse for the pain he had inflicted upon this fine old man this ideal gentleman of the ideal past â the past which he himself so much admired and regretted he would like to spare his old friend any further agitation he was in a state of health where too great excitement might prove fatal but how could he  the negro was guilty and sure to die sooner or later he had not meant to interfere and his intervention might be fruitless

 mr delamere he said gently  there is but one way to gain time you say the negro is innocent appearances are against him the only way to clear him is to produce the real criminal or prove an alibi if you or some other white man of equal standing could swear that the negro was in your presence last night at any hour when this crime could have taken place it might be barely possible to prevent the lynching for the present and when he is tried which will probably be not later than next week he will have every opportunity to defend himself with you to see that he gets no less than justice i think it can be managed though there is still a doubt i will do my best for your sake mr delamere â solely for your sake be it understood and not for that of the negro in whom you are entirely deceived

 i shall not examine your motives carteret replied the other  if you can bring about what i desire

 whatever is done added carteret  must be done quickly it is now four oclock no one can answer for what may happen after seven if he can prove an alibi there may yet be time to save him white men might lynch a negro on suspicion they would not kill a man who was proven by the word of white men to be entirely innocent

 i do not know returned mr delamere shaking his head sadly  after what you have told me it is no longer safe to assume what white men will or will not do â what i have learned here has shaken my faith in humanity i am going away but shall return in a short time shall i find you here  

 i will await your return said carteret

he watched mr delamere pityingly as the old man moved away on the arm of the coachman waiting in the hall he did not believe that mr delamere could prove an alibi for his servant and without some positive proof the negro would surely die â as he well deserved to die

mr ellis was vaguely uncomfortable in the first excitement following the discovery of the crime he had given his bit of evidence and had shared the universal indignation against the murderer when public feeling took definite shape in the intention to lynch the prisoner ellis felt a sudden sense of responsibility growing upon himself when he learned an hour later that it was proposed to burn the negro his part in the affair assumed a still graver aspect for his had been the final word to fix the prisoners guilt

ellis did not believe in lynch law he had argued against it more than once in private conversation and had written several editorials against the practice while in charge of the morning chronicle during major carterets absence a young man however and merely representing another he had not set up as a reformer taking rather the view that this summary method of punishing crime with all its possibilities of error to say nothing of the resulting disrespect of the law and contempt for the timehonored methods of establishing guilt was a mere temporary symptom of the unrest caused by the unsettled relations of the two races at the south there had never before been any special need for any vigorous opposition to lynch law so far as the community was concerned for there had not been a lynching in wellington since ellis had come there eight years before from a smaller town to seek a place for himself in the world of action twenty years before indeed there had been wild doings during the brief kuklux outbreak but that was before elliss time â or at least when he was but a child he had come of a quaker family â the modified quakers of the southâand while sharing in a general way the southern prejudice against the negro his prejudices had been tempered by the peaceful tenets of his fathers sect his father had been a whig and a nonslaveholder and while he had gone with the south in the civil war so far as a man of peace could go he had not done so for love of slavery

as the day wore on elliss personal responsibility for the intended autodafe bore more heavily upon him suppose he had been wrong  he had seen the accused negro  he had recognized him by his clothes his whiskers his spectacles and his walk hut he had also seen another man who resembled sandy so closely that but for the difference in their clothes he was forced to acknowledge he could not have told them apart had he not seen the first man he would have sworn with even greater confidence that the second was sandy there had been he recalled about one of the men â he had not been then nor was he now able to tell which â something vaguely familiar and yet seemingly discordant to whichever of the two it was or as it seemed to him now to any man of that race his mind reverted to the place where he had last seen sandy and then a sudden wave of illumination swept over him and filled him with a thrill of horror the cakewalk â the dancing â the speech â they were not sandys at all nor any negros it was a white man who had stood in the light of the street lamp so that the casual passerby might see and recognize in him old mr delameres servant the scheme was a dastardly one and worthy of a heart that was something worse than weak and vicious

ellis resolved that the negro should not if he could prevent it die for anothers crime but what proof had he himself to offer in support of his theory then again if he denounced tom delamere as the murderer it would involve in all probability the destruction of his own hopes with regard to clara of course she could not marry delamere after the disclosure â the disgraceful episode at the club would have been enough to make that reasonably certain  it had put a nail in delameres coffin but this crime had driven it in to the head and clinched it on the other hand would miss pemberton ever speak again to the man who had been the instrument of bringing disgrace upon the family spies detectives police officers may be useful citizens but they are rarely pleasant company for other people we fee the executioner but we do not touch his bloody hand we might feel a certain tragic admiration for brutus condemning his sons to death but we would scarcely invite brutus to dinner after the event it would harrow our feelings too much

perhaps thought ellis there might be a way out of the dilemma it might be possible to save this innocent negro without for the time being involving delamere he believed that murder will out but it need not be through his initiative he determined to go to the jail and interview the prisoner who might give such an account of himself as would establish his innocence beyond a doubt if so ellis would exert himself to stem the tide of popular fury if as a last resort he could save sandy only by denouncing delamere he would do his duty let it cost him what it might

the gravity of his errand was not lessened by what he saw and heard on the way to the jail the anger of the people was at a white heat a white woman had been assaulted and murdered by a brutal negro neither advanced age nor high social standing had been able to protect her from the ferocity of a black savage her sex which should have been her shield and buckler had made her an easy mark for the villainy of a black brute to take the time to try him would be a criminal waste of public money to hang him would be too slight a punishment for so dastardly a crime an example must be made

already the preparations were under way for the impending execution a trail from the railroad yard had been procured and men were burying it in the square before the jail others were bringing chains and a load of pine wood was piled in convenient proximity some enterprising individual had begun the erection of seats from which for a pecuniary consideration the spectacle might be the more easily and comfortably viewed

ellis was stopped once or twice by persons of his acquaintance from one he learned that the railroads would run excursions from the neighboring towns in order to bring spectators to the scene from another that the burning was to take place early in the evening so that the children might not be kept up beyond their usual bedtime in one group that he passed he heard several young men discussing the question of which portions of the negros body they would prefer for souvenirs ellis shuddered and hastened forward whatever was to be done must be done quickly or it would be too late he saw that already it would require a strong case in favor of the accused to overcome the popular verdict

going up the steps of the jail he met mr delamere who was just coming out after a fruitless interview with sandy

 mr ellis said the old gentleman who seemed greatly agitated  this is monstrous  

 it is indeed sir  returned the younger man  i mean to stop it if i can the negro did not kill mrs ochiltree

mr delamere looked at ellis keenly and as ellis recalled afterwards there was death in his eyes unable to draw a syllable from sandy he had found his servants silence more eloquent than words ellis felt a presentiment that this affair however it might terminate would be fatal to this fine old man whom the city could ill spare in spite of his age and infirmities

 mr ellis asked mr delamere in a voice which trembled with illsuppressed emotion  do you know who killed her  

ellis felt a surging pity for his old friend but every step that he had taken toward the jail had confirmed and strengthened his own resolution that this contemplated crime which he dimly felt to be far more atrocious than that of which sandy was accused in that it involved a whole community rather than one vicious man should be stopped at any cost deplorable enough had the negro been guilty it became in view of his certain innocence an unspeakable horror which for all time would cover the city with infamy

 mr delamere he replied looking the elder man squarely in the eyes  i think i do â and i am very sorry

 and who was it mr ellis  

he put the question hopelessly as though the answer were a foregone conclusion

 i do not wish to say at present replied ellis with a remorseful pang  unless it becomes absolutely necessary to save the negros life accusations are dangerous â as this case proves â unless the proof be certain

for a moment it seemed as though mr delamere would collapse upon the spot rallying almost instantly however he took the arm which ellis involuntarily offered and said with an effort â mr ellis you are a gentleman whom it is an honor to know if you have time i wish you would go with me to my house â i can hardly trust myself alone â and thence to the chronicle office this thing shall be stopped and you will help me stop it it required but a few minutes to cover the half mile that lay between the prison and mr delameres residence

mr delamere went immediately to his grandsons room which he entered alone closing and locking the door behind him he had requested ellis to wait in the carriage

the bed had been made and the room was apparently in perfect order there was a bureau in the room through which mr delamere proceeded to look thoroughly binding one of the drawers locked he tried it with a key of his own and being unable to unlock it took a poker from beside the stove and broke it ruthlessly open

the contents served to confirm what he had heard concerning his grandsons character thrown together in disorderly confusion were bottles of wine and whiskey soiled packs of cards  a dicebox with dice  a box of poker chips several revolvers and a number of photographs and papercovered books at which the old gentleman merely glanced to ascertain their nature

so far while his suspicion had been strengthened he had found nothing to confirm it he searched the room more carefully and found in the woodbox by the small heatingstove which stood in the room a torn and crumpled bit of paper stooping to pick this up his eye caught a gleam of something yellow beneath the bureau which lay directly in his line of vision

first he smoothed out the paper it was apparently the lower half of a label or part of the cover of a small box torn diagonally from corner to corner from the business card at the bottom which gave the name of a firm of manufacturers of theatrical supplies in a northern city and from the letters remaining upon the upper and narrower half the bit of paper had plainly formed part of the wrapper of a package of burnt cork

closing his fingers spasmodically over this damning piece of evidence mr delamere knelt painfully and with the aid of his cane drew out from under the bureau the yellow object which had attracted his attention it was a fivedollar gold piece of a date back toward the beginning of the century

to make assurance doubly sure mr delamere summoned the cook from the kitchen in the back yard in answer to her masters questions sally averred that mr tom had got up very early had knocked at her window â she slept in a room off the kitchen in the yardâ and had told her that she need not bother about breakfast for him as he had had a cold bite from the pantry that he was going hunting and fishing and would be gone all day according to sally mr tom had come in about ten oclock the night before he had forgotten his nightkey sandy was out and she had admitted him with her own key he had said that he was very tired and was going immediately to bed

mr delamere seemed perplexed the crime had been committed later in the evening than ten oclock the cook cleared up the mystery

 i reckon he must a ben dead tied suh fer i went back ter his room fifteen er twenty minutes after he come in fer ter fin out wat he wanted fer breakfus  an i knock two or three times rale had an mistuh tom did n wake up no mo dn de dead he sholy had a good sleep er hed never a got up so ealy

 thank you sally said mr delamere when the woman had finished  that will do

 will you be home ter suppah suh   asked the cook

yes

it was a matter of the supremest indifference to mr delamere whether he should ever eat again but he would not betray his feelings to a servant in a few minutes he was driving rapidly with ellis toward the office of the morning chronicle ellis could see that mr delamere had discovered something of tragic import neither spoke ellis gave all his attention to the horses and mr delamere remained wrapped in his own sombre reflections

when they reached the office they were informed by jerry that major carteret was engaged with general belmont and captain mc bane mr delamere knocked peremptorily at the door of the inner office which was opened by carteret in person

 oh it is you mr delamere

 carteret exclaimed mr delamere  i must speak to you immediately and alone

 exouse me a moment gentlemen said carteret turning to those within the room  ill be back in a moment â dont go away

ellis had left the room closing the door behind him mr delamere and carteret were quite alone

 carteret declared the old gentleman  this murder must not take place

 murder  is a hard word replied the editor frowning slightly

 it is the right word rejoined mr delamere decidedly   it would be a foul and most unnatural murder for sandy did not kill mrs ochiltree carteret with difficulty restrained a smile of pity his old friend was very much excited as the tremor in his voice gave proof the criminal was his trusted servant who had proved unworthy of confidence no one could question mr delameres motives but he was old his judgment was no longer to he relied upon it was a great pity that he should so excite and overstrain himself about a worthless negro who had forfeited his life for a dastardly crime mr delamere had had two paralytic strokes and a third might prove fatal he must be dealt with gently

 mr delamere he said with patient tolerance  i think you are deceived there is but one sure way to stop this execution if your servant is innocent you must produce the real criminal if the negro with such overwhelming proofs against him is not guilty who is  

 i will tell you who is replied mr delamere  the murderer is â the words came with a note of anguish as though torn from his very heart â  the murderer is tom delamere my own grandson 

 impossible sir  exclaimed carteret starting back involuntarily  that could not be  the man was seen leaving the house and he was blaek 

 all cats are gray in the dark carteret and moreover nothing is easier than for a white man to black his face god alone knows how many crimes have been done in this guise tom delamere to get the money to pay his gambling debts committed this foul murder and then tried to fasten it upon as honest and faithful a soul as ever trod the earth

carteret though at first overwhelmed by this announcement perceived with quick intuition that it might easily be true it was but a step from fraud to crime and in delameres need of money there lay a palpable motive for robberyâthe murder may have been an afterthought delamere knew as much about the cedar chest as the negro could have known and more

but a white man must not be condemned without proof positive

 what foundation is there sir he asked  for this astounding charge 

mr delamere related all that had taken place since he had left belleview a couple of hours before and as he proceeded step by step every word carried conviction to carteret tom delameres skill as a mimic and a negro impersonator was well known he had himself laughed at more than one of his performances there had been a powerful motive and mr delameres discoveries had made clear the means toms unusual departure before breakfast on a fishing expedition was a suspicious circumstance there was a certain devilish ingenuity about the affair which he would hardly have expected of tom delamere but for which the reason was clear enough one might have thought that tom would have been satisfied with merely blacking his face and leaving to chance the identification of the negro who might be apprehended he would hardly have implicated out of pure malignity his grandfathers old servant who had been his own caretaker for many years here however carteret could see where toms own desperate position operated to furnish a probable motive for the crime the surest way to head off suspicion from himself was to direct it strongly toward some particular person and this he had been able to do conclusively by his access to sandys clothes his skill in making up to resemble him and by the episode of the silk purse by placing himself beyond reach during the next day he would not be called upon to corroborate or deny any inculpating statements which sandy might make and in the very probable case that the crime should be summarily avenged any such statements on sandys part would be regarded as mere desperate subterfuges of the murderer to save his own life it was a bad affair

 the case seems clear said carteret reluctantly but conclusively  and now what shall we do about it

 i want you to print a handbill said mr delamere  and circulate it through the town stating that sandy campbell is innocent and tom delamere guilty of this crime if this is not done i will go myself and declare it to all who will listen and i will publicly disown the villain who is no more grandson of mine there is no deeper sink of iniquity into which he could fall

carterets thoughts were chasing one another tumultuously there could be no doubt that the negro was innocent from the present aspect of affairs and he must not be lynched but in what sort of position would the white people be placed if mr delamere carried out his spartan purpose of making the true facts known  the white people of the city had raised the issue of their own superior morality and had themselves made this crime a race question

the success of the impending revolution for which he and his confreres had labored so long depended in large measure upon the maintenance of their race prestige which would be injured in the eyes of the world by such a fiasco while they might yet win by sheer force their cause would suffer in the court of morals where they might stand convicted as pirates instead of being applauded as patriots even the negroes would have the laugh on them â the people whom they hoped to make approve and justify their own despoilment to be laughed at by the negroes was a calamity only less terrible than failure or death

such an outcome of an event which had already been heralded to the four corners of the earth would throw a cloud of suspicion upon the stories of outrage which had gone up from the south for so many years and had done so much to win the sympathy of the north for the white south and to alienate it from the colored people the reputation of the race was threatened they must not lynch the negro and yet for the credit of the town its aristocracy and the race the truth of this ghastly story must not see the light â at least not yet

 mr delamere he exclaimed  i am shocked and humiliated the negro must be saved of course but â consider the family honor

 tom is no longer a member of my family i disown him he has covered the family name â my name sir â with infamy we have no longer a family honor i wish never to hear his name spoken again  

for several minutes carteret argued with his old friend then he went into the other room and consulted with general belmont

as a result of these conferences and of certain urgent messages sent out within half an hour thirty or forty of the leading citizens of wellington were gathered in the morning chronicle office several other curious persons observing that there was something in the wind and supposing correctly that it referred to the projected event of the evening crowded in with those who had been invited

carteret was in another room still arguing with mr delamere  its a mere formality sir he was saying suavely accompanied by a mental reservation we know the facts  but this must be done to justify us in the eyes of the mob in calling them oft before they accomplish their purpose

 carteret said the old man in a voice eloquent of the struggle through which he had passed  i would not perjure myself to prolong my own miserable existence another day but god will forgive a sin committed to save anothers life upon your head be it carteret and not on mine 

 gentlemen said carteret entering with mr delamere the room where the men were gathered and raising his hand for silence the people of wellington were on the point of wreaking vengeance upon a negro who was supposed to have been guilty of a terrible crime the white men of this city impelled by the highest and holiest sentiments were about to take steps to defend their hearthstones and maintain the purity and ascendency of their race your purpose sprung from hearts wounded in their tenderest susceptibilities

 bah rah  shouted a tipsy sailor who had edged in with the crowd

 but this same sense of justice continued carteret oratorically  which would lead you to visit swift and terrible punishment upon the guilty would not permit you to slay an innocent man even a negro as long as he behaves himself and keeps in his place is entitled to the protection of the law we may he stern and unbending in the punishment of crime as befits our masterful race but we hold the scales of justice with even and impartial hand

 rah f mpatial han   cried the tipsy sailor who was immediately ejected with slight ceremony

 we have discovered beyond a doubt that the negro sandy campbell now in custody did not commit this robbery and murder but that it was perpetrated by some unknown man who has fled from the city our venerable and distinguished fellow townsman mr delamere in whose employment this campbell has been for many years will vouch for his character and states furthermore that campbell was with him all last night covering any hour at which this crime could have been committed

if mr delamere will swear to that said some one in the crowd  the negro should not be lynched there were murmurs of dissent the preparations had all been made there would be great disappointment if the lynching did not occur

 let mr delamere swear if he wants to save the nigger came again from the crowd

 certainly assented carteret  mr delamere can have no possible objection to taking the oath is there a notary public present or a justice of the peace 

a man stepped forward  i am a justice of the peace he announced

very well mr smith said carteret recognizing the speaker  with your permission i will formulate the oath and mr delamere may repeat it after me if he will i solemnly swear â  i solemnly swear â mr delameres voice might have come from the tomb so hollow and unnatural did it sound

 so help me god â  so help me god â  that the negro sandy campbell now in jail on the charge of murder robbery and assault was in my presence last night between the hours of eight and two oclock

mr delamere repeated this statement in a firm voice  but to ellis who was in the secret his words fell upon the ear like clods dropping upon the coffin in an open grave

 i wish to add said general belmont stepping forward  that it is not our intention to interfere by anything which may be done at this meeting with the orderly process of the law or to advise the prisoners immediate release the prisoner will remain in custody mr delamere major carteret and i guaranteeing that he will be proved entirely innocent at the preliminary hearing tomorrow morning

several of those present looked relieved  others were plainly disappointed but when the meeting ended the news went out that the lynching had been given up carteret immediately wrote and had struck off a handbill giving a brief statement of the proceedings and sent out a dozen boys to distribute copies among the people in the streets that no precaution might be omitted a call was issued to the wellington grays the crack independent military company of the city who in an incredibly short time were on guard at the jail

thus a slight change in the point of view had demonstrated the entire ability of the leading citizens to maintain the dignified and orderly processes of the law whenever they saw fit to do so

the night passed without disorder beyond the somewhat rough handling of two or three careless negroes that came in the way of small parties of the disappointed who had sought alcoholic consolation

at ten oclock the next morning a preliminary hearing of the charge against campbell was had before a magistrate mr delamere perceptibly older and more wizened than he had seemed the day before and leaning heavily on the arm of a servant repeated his statement of the evening before only one or two witnesses were called among whom was mr ellis who swore positively that in his opinion the prisoner was not the man whom he had seen and at first supposed to be campbell the most sensational piece of testimony was that of dr price who had examined the body and who swore that the wound in the head was not necessarily fatal and might have been due to a fall â that she had more than likely died of shock attendant upon the robbery she being of advanced age and feeble health there was no evidence he said of any other personal violence

sandy was not even bound over to the grand jury but was discharged upon the ground that there was not sufficient evidence upon which to hold him upon his release he received the congratulations of many present some of whom would cheerfully have done him to death a few hours before with the childish fickleness of a mob they now experienced a satisfaction almost as great as though less exciting than that attendant upon taking life we speak of the mysteries of inanimate nature the workings of the human heart are the profoundest mystery of the universe one moment they make us despair of our kind and the next we see in them the reflection of the divine image sandy having thus escaped from the mr hyde of the mob now received the benediction of its dr jekyll being no cynical philosopher and realizing how nearly the jaws of death had closed upon him he was profoundly grateful for his escape and felt not the slightest desire to investigate or criticise any mans motives

with the testimony of dr price the worst feature of the affair came to an end the murder eliminated or rendered doubtful the crime became a mere vulgar robbery the extent of which no one could estimate since no living soul knew how much money mrs ochiltree had had in the cedar chest the absurdity of the remaining charge became more fully apparent in the light of the reaction from the excitement of the day before

nothing further was ever done about the case but though the crime went unpunished it carried evil in its train as we have seen the charge against campbell had been made against the whole colored race all over the united states the associated press had flashed the report of another dastardly outrage by a burly black brute â all black brutes it seems are burly â and of the impending lynching with its prospective horrors this news being highly sensational in its character had been displayed in large black type on the front pages of the daily papers the dispatch that followed to the effect that the accused had been found innocent and the lynching frustrated received slight attention if any in a fineprint paragraph on an inside page the facts of the case never came out at all the family honor of the delameres was preserved and the prestige of the white race in wellington was not seriously impaired

upon leaving the preliminary hearing old mr delamere had requested general belmont to call at his house during the day upon professional business this the general did in the course of the afternoon

 belmont said mr delamere  i wish to make my will i should have drawn it with my own hand  but you know my motives and can testify to my soundness of mind and memory

he thereupon dictated a will by the terms of which he left to his servant sandy campbell three thousand dollars as a mark of the testators appreciation of services rendered and sufferings endured by sandy on behalf of his master after some minor dispositions the whole remainder of the estate was devised to dr william miller in trust for the uses of his hospital and trainingschool for nurses on condition that the institution be incorporated and placed under the management of competent trustees tom delamere was not mentioned in the will

 there belmont he said  that load is off my mind now if you will call in some witnessesâ most of my people can write âi shall feel entirely at ease

the will was signed by mr delamere and witnessed by jeff and billy two servants in the house neither of whom received any information as to its contents beyond the statement that they were witnessing their masters will

 i wish to leave that with you for safe keeping belmont said mr delamere after the witnesses had retired  lock it up in your safe until i die which will not be very long since i have no further desire to live

an hour later mr delamere suffered a third paralytic stroke from which he died two days afterwards without having in the meantime recovered the power of speech

the will was never produced the servants stated and general belmont admitted that mr delamere had made a will a few days before his death but since it was not discoverable it seemed probable that the testator had destroyed it this was all the more likely the general was inclined to think because the will had been of a most unusual character what the contents of the will were he of course did not state it having been made under the seal of professional secrecy

this suppression was justified by the usual race argument millers hospital was already well established and like most negro institutions could no doubt rely upon northern philanthropy for any further support it might need mr delameres property belonged of right to the white race and by the higher law should remain in the possession of white people loyalty to ones race was a more sacred principle than deference to a weak old mans whims

having reached this conclusion general belmonts first impulse was to destroy the will on second thoughts he locked it carefully away in his safe he would hold it awhile it might some time be advisable to talk the matter over with young delamere who was of a fickle disposition and might wish to change his legal adviser

wellington soon resumed its wonted calm and in a few weeks the intended lynching was only a memory the robbery and assault however still remained a mystery to all but a chosen few the affair had been dropped as absolutely as though it had never occurred no colored man ever learned the reason of this sudden change of front and sandy campbells loyalty to his old employers memory kept him silent tom delamere did not offer to retain sandy in his service though he presented him with most of the old gentlemans wardrobe it is only justice to tom to state that up to this time he had not been informed of the contents of his grandfathers latest will major carteret gave sandy employment as butler thus making a sort of vicarious atonement on the part of the white race of which the major felt himself in a way the embodiment for the risk to which sandy had been subjected

shortly after these events sandy was restored to the bosom of the church and enfolded by its sheltering arms was no longer tempted to stray from the path of rectitude but became even a more rigid methodist than before his recent troubles

tom delamere did not call upon clara again in the character of a lover of course they could not help meeting from time to time but he never dared presume upon their former relations indeed the social atmosphere of wellington remained so frigid toward delamere that he left town and did not return for several months

ellis was aware that delamere had been thrown over but a certain delicacy restrained him from following up immediately the advantage which the absence of his former rival gave him it seemed to him with the quixotry of a clean pure mind that clara would pass through a period of mourning for her lost illusion and that it would be indelicate for the time being to approach her with a lovers attentions the work of the office had been unusually heavy of late the major deeply absorbed in politics left the detail work of the paper to ellis into the intimate counsels of the revolutionary committee ellis had not been admitted nor would he have desired to be he knew of course in a general way the results that it was sought to achieve and while he did not see their necessity he deferred to the views of older men and was satisfied to remain in ignorance of anything which he might disapprove moreover his own personal affairs occupied his mind to an extent that made politics or any other subject a matter of minor importance

as for dr miller he never learned of mr delameres good intentions toward his institution but regretted the old gentlemans death as the loss of a sincere friend and wellwisher of his race in their unequal struggle

despite the untiring zeal of carteret and his associates the campaign for the restriction of the suffrage which was to form the basis of a permanent white supremacy had seemed to languish for a while after the ochiltree affair the lull however was only temporary and more apparent than real for the forces adverse to the negro were merely gathering strength for a more vigorous assault while little was said in wellington public sentiment all over the country became every day more favorable to the views of the conspirators the nation was rushing forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and worlddominion before the exigencies of which mere abstract ethical theories must not be permitted to stand the same argument that justified the conquest of an inferior nation could not be denied to those who sought the suppression of an inferior race in the south an obscure jealousy of the negros progress an obscure fear of the very equality so contemptuously denied furnished a rich soil for successful agitation statistics of crime ingeniously manipulated were made to present a fearful showing against the negro vital statistics were made to prove that he had degenerated from an imaginary standard of physical excellence which had existed under the benign influence of slavery constant lynchings emphasized his impotence and bred everywhere a growing contempt for his rights

at the north a new pharaoh had risen who knew not israel â a new generation who knew little of the fierce passions which had played around the negro in a past epoch and derived their opinions of him from the  coon song  and the police reports those of his old friends who survived were disappointed that he had not flown with clipped wings  that he had not in one generation of limited opportunity attained the level of the whites the whole race question seemed to have reached a sort of impasse a blind alley of which no one could see the outlet the negro had become a target at which any one might try a shot schoolboys gravely debated the question as to whether or not the negro should exercise the franchise the pessimist gave him up in despair while the optimist smilingly confident that everything would come out all right in the end also turned aside and went his buoyant way to more pleasing themes

for a time there were white men in the state who opposed any reactionary step unless it were of general application they were conscientious men who had learned the ten commandments and wished to do right but this class was a small minority and their objections were soon silenced by the allpowerful race argument selfishness is the most constant of human motives patriotism humanity or the love of god may lead to sporadic outbursts which sweep away the heapedup wrongs of centuries but they languish at times while the love of self works on ceaselessly unwearyingly burrowing always at the very roots of life and heaping up fresh wrongs for other centuries to sweep away the state was at the mercy of venal and selfseeking politicians bent upon regaining their ascendency at any cost stultifying their own minds by vague sophistries and highsounding phrases which deceived none but those who wished to be deceived and these but imperfectly and dulling the public conscience by a loud clamor in which the calm voice of truth was for the moment silenced so the cause went on

carteret as spokesman of the campaign and sincerest of all its leaders performed prodigies of labor the morning chronicle proclaimed in season and out the doctrine of  white supremacy leaving the paper in charge of ellis the major made a tour of the state rousing the white people of the better class to an appreciation of the terrible danger which confronted them in the possibility that a few negroes might hold a few offices or dictate the terms upon which white men should fill them difficulties were explained away the provisions of the federal constitution it was maintained must yield to the higher law and if the constitution could neither be altered nor bent to this end means must be found to circumvent it

the device finally hit upon for disfranchising the colored people in this particular state was the notorious  grandfather clause after providing various restrictions of the suffrage based upon education character and property which it was deemed would in effect disfranchise the colored race an exception was made in favor of all citizens whose fathers or grandfathers had been entitled to vote prior to  since none but white men could vote prior to  this exception obviously took in the poor and ignorant whites while the same class of negroes were excluded

 it was ingenious but it was not fair in due time a constitutional convention was called in which the above scheme was adopted and submitted to a vote of the people for ratification the campaign was fought on the color line many white republicans deluded with the hope that by the elimination of the negro vote their party might receive accessions from the democratic ranks went over to the white party by fraud in one place by terrorism in another and everywhere by the resistless moral force of the united whites the negroes were reduced to the apathy of despair their few white allies demoralized and the amendment adopted by a large majority the negroes were taught that this is a white mans country and that the sooner they made up their minds to this fact the better for all concerned the white people would be good to them so long as they behaved themselves and kept their place as theoretical equals â practical equality being forever out of the question either by nature or by law â there could have been nothing but strife between them in which the weaker party would invariably have suffered most

some colored men accepted the situation thus outlined if not as desirable at least as inevitable most of them however had little faith in this condescending friendliness which was to take the place of constitutional rights they knew they had been treated unfairly that their enemies had prevailed against them that their whilom friends had stood passively by and seen them undone many of the most enterprising and progressive left the state and those who remain still labor under a sense of wrong and outrage which renders them distinctly less valuable as citizens

the great steal was made but the thieves did not turn honest â the scheme still shows the mark of the burglars tools sins like chickens come home to roost the south paid a fearful price for the wrong of negro slavery in some form or other it will doubtless reap the fruits of this later iniquity

drastic as were these reforms the results of which we have anticipated somewhat since the new constitution was not to take effect immediately they moved all too slowly for the little coterie of wellington conspirators whose ambitions and needs urged them to prompt action under the new constitution it would be two full years before the nigger amendment became effective and meanwhile the wellington district would remain hopelessly republican the committee decided about two months before the fall election that an active local campaign must be carried on with a view to discourage the negroes from attending the polls on election day

the question came up for discussion one forenoon in a meeting at the office of the morning chronicle at which all of the  big three  were present

 something must be done declared mc bane  and that damn quick too many white people are saying that it will be better to wait until the amendment goes into effect that would mean to leave the niggers in charge of this town for two years after the state has declared for white supremacy im opposed to leaving it in their hands one hour â thems my sentiments 

this proved to be the general opinion and the discussion turned to the subject of ways and means

 what became of that editorial in the nigger paper   inquired the general in his blandest tones cleverly directing a smoke ring toward the ceiling  it lost some of its point back there when we came near lynching that nigger  but now that that has blown over why wouldnt it be a good thing to bring into play at the present juncture  lets read it over again

carteret extracted the paper from the pigeonhole where he had placed it some months before the article was read aloud with emphasis and discussed phrase by phrase of its wording there could be little criticism â it was temperately and even cautiously phrased as suggested by the general the ochiltree affair had proved that it was not devoid of truth its great offensiveness lay in its boldness that a negro should publish in a newspaper what white people would scarcely acknowledge to themselves in secret was much as though a russian moujik or a german peasant should rush into print to question the divine right of the lords anointed the article was racial lesemajeste in the most aggravated form a peg was needed upon which to hang a coup c tetat and this editorial offered the requisite opportunity it was unanimously decided to republish the obnoxious article with comment adapted to fire the inflammable southern heart and rouse it against any further selfassertion of the negroes in politics or elsewhere

 the time is ripe   exclaimed mc bane  in a month we can have the niggers so scared that they wont dare stick their heads out of doors on lection day

 i wonder observed the general thoughtfully after this conclusion had been reached if we couldnt have jerry fetch us some liquor

jerry appeared in response to the usual summons the general gave him the money and ordered three calhoun cocktails when jerry returned with the glasses on a tray the general observed him with pointed curiosity

what in hâ is the matter with you jerry your black face is splotched with brown and yellow patches and your hair shines as though you had fallen headforemost into a firkin of butter whats the matter with you 

jerry seemed much embarrassed by this inquiry

nothin suh nothin he stammered its â its jes somethin i ben puttin on my hair suli ter improve de quality suh

 jerry returned the general bending a solemn look upon the porter  you have been playing with edged tools and your days are numbered you have been reading the afroamerican bnner

he shook open the paper which he had retained in his hand and read from one of the advertisements  â   kinky curly hair made straight in two applications dark skins lightened two shades mulattoes turned perfectly white  this stuff is rank poison jerry continued the general with a mock solemnity which did not impose upon jerry who nevertheless listened with an air of great alarm he suspected that the general was making fun of him but he also knew that the general would like to think that jerry believed him in earnest and to please the white folks was jerrys consistent aim in life  i can see the signs of decay in your face and your hair will all fall out in a week or two at the latest â mark my words  

mc bane had listened to this pleasantry with a sardonic sneer it was a waste of valuable time to carteret it seemed in doubtful taste these grotesque advertisements had their tragic side they were proof that the negroes had read the handwriting on the wall these pitiful attempts to change their physical characteristics were an acknowledgment on their own part that the negro was doomed and that the white man was to inherit the earth and hold all other races under his heel for as the months had passed carterets thoughts centring more and more upon the negro had led him farther and farther until now he was firmly convinced that there was no permanent place for the negro in the united states if indeed anywhere in the world except under the ground more pathetic even than jerrys efforts to escape from the universal doom of his race was his ignorance that even if he could by some strange alchemy bleach his skin and straighten his hair there would still remain underneath it all only the unbleached darky â the ass in the lions skin

when the general had finished his facetious lecture jerry backed out of the room shamefacedly though affecting a greater confusion than he really felt jerry had not reasoned so closely as carteret but he had realized that it was a distinct advantage to be whiteâan advantage which white people had utilized to secure all the best things in the world and he had entertained the vague hope that by changing his complexion he might share this prerogative while he suspected the generals sincerity he nevertheless felt a little apprehensive lest the generals prediction about the effects of the facebleach and other preparations might prove true â the general was a white gentleman and ought to know â and decided to abandon their use

this purpose was strengthened by his next interview with the major when carteret summoned him an hour later after the other gentlemen had taken their leave jerry had washed his head thoroughly and there remained no trace of the pomade an attempt to darken the lighter spots in his cuticle by the application of printers ink had not proved equally successful â the retouching left the spots as much too dark as they had formerly been too light

 jerry said carteret sternly  when i hired you to work for the chronicle you were black the word  negro  means  black the best negro is a black negro of the pure type as it came from the hand of god if you wish to get along well with the white people the blacker you are the better â white people do not like negroes who want to be white a man should be content to remain as god made him and where god placed him so no more of this nonsense are you going to vote at the next election  

 what would you vise me ter do suh   asked jerry cautiously

 i do not advise you you ought to have sense enough to see where your own interests lie i put it to you whether you cannot trust yourself more safely in the hands of white gentlemen who are your true friends than in the hands of ignorant and purchasable negroes and unscrupulous white scoundrels  

 deres no doubt about it suh assented jerry with a vehemence proportioned to his desire to get back into favor  i ain gwine ter have nothin ter do wid de lection suh  ef i don vote i kin keep my job cant i suh  

the major eyed jerry with an air of supreme disgust what could be expected of a race so utterly devoid of tact  it seemed as though this negro thought a white gentleman might want to bribe him to remain away from the polls  and the negros willingness to accept the imaginary bribe demonstrated the venal nature of the colored race â its entire lack of moral principle

 you will retain your place jerry he said severely  so long as you perform your duties to my satisfaction and behave yourself properly

with this grandiloquent subterfuge carteret turned to his next article on white supremacy jerry did not delude himself with any finespun sophistry he knew perfectly well that he held his job upon the condition that he stayed away from the polls at the approaching election jerry was a fool â  the world of fools hath such a store that he who would not see an ass must stay at home and shut his door and break his lookingglass

but while no one may be entirely wise there are degrees of folly and jerry was not all kinds of a fool

events moved rapidly during the next few days the reproduction in the chronicle of the article from the afroamerican banner with carterets inflammatory comment took immediate effect it touched the southern white man in his most sensitive spot to him such an article was an insult to white womanhood and must be resented by some active steps â mere words would be no answer at all to meet words with words upon such a subject would be to acknowledge the equality of the negro and his right to discuss or criticise the conduct of the white people

the colored people became alarmed at the murmurings of the whites which seemed to presage a coming storm a number of them sought to arm themselves but ascertained upon inquiring at the stores that no white merchant would sell a negro firearms since all the dealers in this sort of merchandise were white men the negroes had to be satisfied with oiling up the old army muskets which some of them possessed and the few revolvers with which a small rowdy element generally managed to keep themselves supplied upon an effort being made to purchase firearms from a northern city the express company controlled by local men refused to accept the consignment the white people on the other hand procured both arms and ammunition in large quantities and the wellington grays drilled with great assiduity at their armory

all this went on without any public disturbance of the towns tranquillity a stranger would have seen nothing to excite his curiosity the white people did their talking among themselves and merely grew more distant in their manner toward the colored folks who instinctively closed their ranks as the whites drew away with each day that passed the feeling grew more tense the editor of the afroamerican banner whose office had been quietly garrisoned for several nights by armed negroes became frightened and disappeared from the town between two suns

the conspirators were jubilant at the complete success of their plans it only remained for them to so direct this aroused public feeling that it might completely accomplish the desired end â to change the political complexion of the city government and assure the ascendency of the whites until the amendment should go into effect a revolution and not a riot was contemplated

with this end in view another meeting was called at carterets office

we are now ready announced general belmont for the final act of this drama we must decide promptly or events may run away from us

 what do you suggest   asked carteret

down in the american tropics continued the general  they have a way of doing things i was in nicaragua ten years ago when paternos revolution drove out igorrotos government it was as easy as falling off a log paterno had the arms and the best men igorroto was not looking for trouble and the guns were at his breast before he knew it we have the guns the negroes are not expecting trouble and are easy to manage compared with the fiery mixture that flourishes in the tropics

 i should not advocate murder returned carteret  we are animated by high and holy principles we wish to right a wrong to remedy an abuse to save our state from anarchy and our race from humiliation i dont object to frightening the negroes but i am opposed to unnecessary bloodshed

 im not quite so particular struck in mc bane  they need to be taught a lesson and a nigger more or less wouldnt be missed theres too many of em now

 of course continued carteret  if we should decide upon a certain mode of procedure and the negroes should resist a different reasoning might apply  but i will have no premeditated murder

 in central and south america observed the general reflectively  none are hurt except those who get in the way

 therell be no niggers hurt said mc bane contemptuously  unless they strain themselves running one white man can chase a hundred of em ive managed five hundred at a time ill pay for burying all the niggers that are killed

the conference resulted in a welldefined plan to be put into operation the following day by which the city government was to be wrested from the republicans and their negro allies

 and now said general belmont  while we are cleansing the augean stables we may as well remove the cause as the effect there are several negroes too many in this town which will be much the better without them theres that yellow lawyer watson

hes altogether too mouthy and has too much business every nigger that gets into trouble sends for watson and white lawyers with families to support and social positions to keep up are deprived of their legitimate source of income

theres that damn nigger real estate agent blurted out mc bane  billy kitchen used to get most of the nigger business but this darky has almost driven him to the poorhouse a white business man is entitled to a living in his own profession and his own home that nigger dont belong here nohow he came from the north a year or two ago and is hand in glove with barber the nigger editor which is enough of itself to damn him hell have to go  

 how about the collector of the port  

 wed better not touch him it would bring the government down upon us which we want to avoid we dont need to worry about the nigger preachers either they want to stay here where the loaves and the fishes are we can make em write letters to the newspapers justifying our course as a condition of their remaining

 what about billings   asked mc bane billings was the white republican mayor  is that skunk to be allowed to stay in town  

 no returned the general  every white republican officeholder ought to be made to go this town is only big enough for democrats and negroes who can be taught to keep their place

 what about the colored doctor queried mc bane  with the hospital and the diamond ring and the carriage and the other fallals  

 i shouldnt interfere with miller replied the general decisively  hes a very good sort of a negro doesnt meddle with politics nor tread on any one elses toes his father was a good citizen which counts in his favor hes spending money in the community too and contributes to its prosperity

 that sort of nigger though sets a bad example retorted mc bane  they make it all the harder to keep the rest of em down

  one swallow does not make a summer  quoted the general  when we get things arranged therell be no trouble a stream cannot rise higher than its fountain and a smart nigger without a constituency will no longer be an object of fear i say let the doctor alone

 hell have to keep mighty quiet though muttered mc bane discontentedly i dont like smart niggers ive had to shoot several of them in the course of my life

 personally i dislike the man interposed carteret  and if i consulted my own inclinations would say expel him with the rest but my grievance is a personal one and to gratify it in that way would be a loss to the community i wish to be strictly impartial in this matter and to take no step which cannot be entirely justified by a wise regard for the public welfare

 whats the use of all this hypocrisy gentlemen   sneered mc bane  every last one of us has an axe to grind  the major may as well put an edge on his well never get a better chance to have things our way if this nigger doctor annoys the major well run him out with the rest this is a white mans country and a white mans city and no nigger has any business here when a white man wants him gone  carteret frowned darkly at this brutal characterization of their motives it robbed the enterprise of all its poetry and put a solemn act of revolution upon the plane of a mere vulgar theft of power even the general winced

 i would not consent he said irritably  to millers being disturbed

mc bane made no further objection

there was a discreet knock at the door

 come in said carteret

jerry entered  mistuh ellis wants ter speak ter you a minute suh he said

carteret excused himself and left the room

jerry said the general you lump of ebony the sight of you reminds me if your master doesnt want you for a minute step across to mr browns and tell him to send me three cocktails

 yas suh responded jerry hesitating the general had said nothing about paying

 and tell him jerry to charge them im short of change today

yas suh yas suh replied jerry as he backed out of the presence adding when he had reached the hall  dere ain no change fer jerry dis time sho ill jes make dat fo cocktails an de ginl wont never know de diffence i ain gwine cross de road fer nothin not ef i knows it

half an hour later the conspirators dispersed they had fixed the hour of the proposed revolution the course to be pursued the results to be obtained  but in stating their equation they had overlooked one factor â god or fate or whatever one may choose to call the power that holds the destinies of man in the hollow of his hand

mrs carteret was very much disturbed it was supposed that the shock of her aunts death had affected her health for since that event she had fallen into a nervous condition which gave the major grave concern much to the general surprise mrs ochiltree had left no will and no property of any considerable value except her homestead which descended to mrs carteret as the natural heir whatever she may have had on hand in the way of ready money had undoubtedly been abstracted from the cedar chest by the midnight marauder to whose visit her death was immediately due her nieces grief was held to mark a deepseated affection for the grim old woman who had reared her

mrs carterets present state of mind of which her nervousness was a sufficiently accurate reflection did in truth date from her aunts death and also in part from the time of the conversation with mrs ochiltree one afternoon during and after the drive past millers new hospital mrs ochiltree had grown steadily more and more childish after that time and her niece had never succeeded in making her pick up the thread of thought where it had been dropped at any rate mrs ochiltree had made no further disclosure upon the subject

an examination not long after her aunts death of the papers found near the cedar chest on the morning after the murder had contributed to mrs carterets enlightenment but had not promoted her peace of mind

when mrs carteret reached home after her hurried exploration of the cedar chest she thrust into a bureau drawer the envelope she had found so fully was her mind occupied for several days with the funeral and with the excitement attending the arrest of sandy campbell that she deferred the examination of the contents of the envelope until near the end of the week

one morning while alone in her chamber she drew the envelope from the drawer and was holding it in her hand hesitating as to whether or not she should open it when the baby in the next room began to cry

 the childs cry seemed like a warning and yielding to a vague uneasiness she put the paper back

 phil she said to her husband at luncheon  aunt polly said some strange things to me one day before she died â i dont know whether she was quite in her right mind or not but suppose that my father had left a will by which it was provided that half his property should go to that woman and her child

 it would never have gone by such a will replied the major easily  your aunt polly was in her dotage and merely dreaming your father would never have been such a fool but even if he had no such will could have stood the test of the courts it would clearly have been due to the improper influence of a designing woman

 so that legally as well as morally said mrs carteret  the will would have been of no effect  

 not the slightest a jury would soon have broken down the legal claim as for any moral obligation there would have been nothing moral about the affair the only possible consideration for such a gift was an immoral one i dont wish to speak harshly of your father my dear but his conduct was gravely reprehensible the woman herself had no right or claim whatever she would have been whipped and expelled from the town if justice â blind bleeding justice then prostrate at the feet of slaves and aliens â could have had her way  

 but the child  â  the child was in the same category who was she to have inherited the estate of your ancestors of which a few years before she would herself have formed a part the child of shame it was hers to pay the penalty but the discussion is all in the air olivia your father never did and never would have left such a will

this conversation relieved mrs carterets uneasiness going to her room shortly afterwards she took the envelope from her bureau drawer and drew out a bulky paper the haunting fear that it might be such a will as her aunt had suggested was now removed  for such an instrument in the light of what her husband had said confirming her own intuitions would be of no valid effect it might be just as well she thought to throw the paper in the fire without looking at it she wished to think as well as might be of her father and she felt that her respect for his memory would not be strengthened by the knowledge that he had meant to leave his estate away from her for her aunts words had been open to the construction that she was to have been left destitute curiosity strongly prompted her to read the paper perhaps the will contained no such provision as she had feared and it might convey some request or direction which ought properly to be complied with

she had been standing in front of the bureau while these thoughts passed through her mind and now dropping the envelope back into the drawer mechanically she unfolded the document it was written on legal paper in her fathers own hand

mrs carteret was not familiar with legal verbiage and there were several expressions of which she did not perhaps appreciate the full effect but a very hasty glance enabled her to ascertain the purport of the paper it was a will by which in one item her father devised to his daughter janet the child of the woman known as julia brown the sum of ten thousand dollars and a certain plantation or tract of land a short distance from the town of wellington the rest and residue of his estate after deducting all legal charges and expenses was bequeathed to his beloved daughter olivia merkell

mrs carteret breathed a sigh of relief her father had not preferred another to her but had left to his lawful daughter the bulk of his estate she felt at the same time a growing indignation at the thought that that woman should so have wrought upon her fathers weakness as to induce him to think of leaving so much valuable property to her bastard â property which by right should go and now would go to her own son to whom by every rule of law and decency it ought to descend

a fire was burning in the next room on account of the baby â there had been a light frost the night before and the air was somewhat chilly for the moment the room was empty mrs carteret came out from her chamber and threw the offending paper into the fire and watched it slowly burn when it had been consumed the carbon residue of one sheet still retained its form and she could read the words on the charred portion a sentence which had escaped her eye in her rapid reading stood out in ghostly black upon the gray background  â  all the rest and residue of my estate i devise and bequeath to my daughter olivia merkell the child of my beloved first wife

mrs carteret had not before observed the word first instinctively she stretched toward the fire the poker which she held in her hand and at its touch the shadowy remnant fell to pieces and nothing but ashes remained upon the hearth

not until the next morning did she think again of the envelope which had contained the paper she had burned opening the drawer where it lay the oblong blue envelope confronted her the sight of it was distasteful the indorsed side lay uppermost and the words seemed like a mute reproach â  the last will and testament of samuel merkell

snatching up the envelope she glanced into it mechanically as she moved toward the next room and perceived a thin folded paper which had heretofore escaped her notice when opened it proved to be a certificate of marriage in due form between samuel merkell and julia brown it was dated from a county in south carolina about two years before her fathers death

for a moment mrs carteret stood gazing blankly at this faded slip of paper her father had married this woman â at least he had gone through the form of marriage with her for to him it had surely been no more than an empty formality the marriage of white and colored persons was forbidden by law only recently she had read of a case where both the parties to such a crime a colored man and a white woman had been sentenced to long terms in the penitentiary she even recalled the circumstances the couple had been living together unlawfully â they were very low people whose private lives were beneath the public noticeâbut influenced by a religious movement pervading the community had sought they said at the trial to secure the blessing of god upon their union the higher law which imperiously demanded that the purity and prestige of the white race be preserved at any cost had intervened at this point

mechanically she moved toward the fireplace so dazed by this discovery as to be scarcely conscious of her own actions she surely had not formed any definite intention of destroying this piece of paper when her fingers relaxed unconsciously and let go their hold upon it the draught swept it toward the fireplace ere scarcely touching the flames it caught blazed fiercely and shot upward with the current of air a moment later the record of poor julias marriage was scattered to the four winds of heaven as her poor body had long since mingled with the dust of earth

the letter remained unread in her agitation at the discovery of the marriage certificate olivia had almost forgotten the existence of the letter it was addressed to john delamere esq as executor of my last will and testament while the lower lefthand corner bore the direction  to be delivered only after my death with seal unbroken

the seal was broken already mr delamere was dead the letter could never he delivered mrs carteret unfolded it and read â my dear delamere â i have taken the liberty of naming you as executor of my last will because you are my friend and the only man of my acquaintance whom i feel that i can trust to carry out my wishes appreciate my motives and preserve the silence i desire

i have first a confession to make inclosed in this letter you will find a certificate of marriage between my child janets mother and myself while i have never exactly repented of this marriage i have never had the courage to acknowledge it openly if i had not married julia i fear polly ochiltree would have married me by main force â as she would marry you or any other gentleman unfortunate enough to fall in the way of this twicewidowed manhunter when my wife died three years ago her sister polly offered to keep house for me and the child i would sooner have had the devil in the house and yet i trembled with alarm â there seemed no way of escape â it was so clearly and obviously the proper thing

but she herself gave me my opportunity i was on the point of consenting when she demanded as a condition of her coming that i discharge julia my late wifes maid she was laboring under a misapprehension in regard to the girl but i grasped at the straw and did everything to foster her delusion i declared solemnly that nothing under heaven would induce me to part with julia the controversy resuited in my permitting polly to take the child while i retained the maid

before polly put this idea into my head i had scarcely looked at julia hut this outbreak turned my attention toward her she was a handsome girl and as i soon found out a good girl my wife who raised her was a christian woman and had taught her modesty and virtue she was free the air was full of liberty and equal rights and all the abolition claptrap and she made marriage a condition of her remaining longer in the house in a moment of weakness i took her away to a place where we were not known and married her if she had left me i should have fallen a victim to polly ochiltree â to which any fate was preferable

and then old friend my weakness kept to the fore i was ashamed of this marriage and my new wife saw it moreover she loved me â too well indeed to wish to make me unhappy the ceremony had satisfied her conscience had set her right she said with god for the opinions of men she did not care since i loved her â she only wanted to compensate me as best she could for the great honor i had done my handmaiden â for she had read her bible and i was the abraham to her hagar compared with whom she considered herself at a great advantage it was her own proposition that nothing be said of this marriage if any shame should fall on her it would fall lightly for it would be undeserved when the child came she still kept silence no one she argued could blame an innocent child for the accident of birth and in the sight of god this child had every right to exist while among her own people illegitimacy would involve but little stigma

i need not say that i was easily persuaded to accept this sacrifice but touched by her fidelity i swore to provide handsomely for them both this i have tried to do by the will of which i ask you to act as executor had i left the child more it might serve as a ground for attacking the will my acknowledgment of the tie of blood is sufficient to justify a reasonable bequest

i have taken this course for the sake of my daughter olivia who is dear to me and whom i would not wish to make ashamed and in deference to public opinion which it is not easy to defy if after my death julia should choose to make our secret known i shall of course be beyond the reach of hard words  but loyalty to my memory will probably keep her silent a strong man would long since have acknowledged her before the world and taken the consequences  but alas i am only myself and the atmosphere i live in does not encourage moral heroism i should like to be different but it is god who hath made us and not we ourselves

nevertheless old friend i will ask of you one favor if in the future this child of julias and of mine should grow to womanhood  if she should prove to have her mothers gentleness and love of virtue  if in the new era which is opening up for her mothers race to which unfortunately she must belong she should become in time an educated woman and if the time should ever come when by virtue of her education or the development of her people it would be to her a source of shame or unhappiness that she was an illegitimate child â if you are still alive old friend and have the means of knowing or divining this thing go to her and tell her for me that she is my lawful child and ask her to forgive her fathers weakness

when this letter comes to you i shall have passed to â the beyond hut i am confident that you will accept this trust for which i thank you now in advance most heartily

the letter was signed with her fathers name the same signature which had been attached to the will

having firmly convinced herself of the illegality of the papers and of her own right to destroy them mrs carteret ought to have felt relieved that she had thus removed all traces of her dead fathers folly true the other daughter remained â she had seen her on the street only the day before the sight of this person she had always found offensive and now she felt in view of what she had just learned it must be even more so never while this woman lived in the town would she be able to throw the veil of forgetfulness over this blot upon her fathers memory

as the day wore on mrs carteret grew still less at ease to herself marriage was a serious thing â to a rightthinking woman the most serious concern of life a marriage certificate rightfully procured was scarcely less solemn so far as it went than the bible itself her own she cherished as the apple of her eye it was the evidence of her wifehood the seal of her childs legitimacy her patent of nobility â the token of her own and her childs claim to social place and consideration she had burned this pretended marriage certificate because it meant nothing nevertheless she could not ignore the knowledge of another such marriage of which every one in the town knew â a celebrated case indeed where a white man of a family quite as prominent as her fathers had married a colored woman during the military occupation of the state just after the civil war the legality of the marriage had never been questioned it had been fully consummated by twenty years of subsequent cohabitation no amount of social persecution had ever shaken the position of the husband with an iron will he had stayed on in the town a living protest against the established customs of the south so rudely interrupted for a few short years and though his children were negroes though he had never appeared in public with his wife no one had ever questioned the validity of his marriage or the legitimacy of his offspring

the marriage certificate which mrs carteret had burned dated from the period of the military occupation hence mrs carteret who was a good woman and would not have done a dishonest thing felt decidedly uncomfortable she had destroyed the marriage certificate but its ghost still haunted her

major carteret having just eaten a good dinner was in a very agreeable humor when that same evening his wife brought up again the subject of their previous discussion

 phil she asked  aunt polly told me that once long before my father died when she went to remonstrate with him for keeping that woman in the house he threatened to marry julia if aunt polly ever said another word to him about the matter suppose he had married her and had then left a will â would the marriage have made any difference so far as the will was concerned  

major carteret laughed  your aunt polly he said  was a remarkable woman with a wonderful imagination which seems to have grown more vivid as her memory and judgment weakened why should your father marry his negro housemaid  mr merkell was never rated as a fool â he had one of the clearest heads in wellington i saw him only a day or two before he died and i could swear before any court in christendom that he was of sound mind and memory to the last these notions of your aunt were mere delusions your father was never capable of such a folly

 of course i am only supposing a case returned olivia  imagining such a case just for the argument would the marriage have been legal  

 that would depend if he had married her during the military occupation or over in south carolina the marriage would have been legally valid though morally and socially outrageous

 and if he had died afterwards leaving a will  

 the will would have controlled the disposition of his estate in all probability

 suppose he had left no will  

you are getting the matter down pretty fine my dear the woman would have taken one third of the real estate for life and could have lived in the homestead until she died she would also have had half the other property â the money and goods and furniture everything except the land â and the negro child would have shared with you the balance of the estate that i believe is according to the law of descent and distribution

mrs carteret lapsed into a troubled silence her father had married the woman in her heart she had no doubt of the validity of the marriage so far as the law was concerned if one marriage of such a kind would stand another contracted under similar conditions was equally as good if the marriage had been valid julias child had been legitimate the will she had burned gave this sister of hers â she shuddered at the word âbut a small part of the estate under the law which intervened now that there was no will the property should have been equally divided if the woman had been white â but the woman had not been white and the same rule of moral conduct did not could not in the very nature of things apply as between white people  for if this were not so slavery had been not merely an economic mistake but a great crime against humanity if it had been such a crime as for a moment she dimly perceived it might have been then through the long centuries there had been piled up a catalogue of wrong and outrage which if the law of compensation be a law of nature must some time somewhere in some way be atoned for she herself had not escaped the penalty of which she realized this burden placed upon her conscience was but another installment

if she should make known the facts she had learned it would mean whatâa division of her fathers estate a recognition of the legality of her fathers relations with julia such a stain upon her fathers memory would be infinitely worse than if he had not married her to have lived with her without marriage was a social misdemeanor at which society in the old days had winked or at most had frowned to have married her was to have committed the unpardonable social sin such a scandal mrs carteret could not have endured should she seek to make restitution it would necessarily involve the disclosure of at least some of the facts had she not destroyed the will she might have compromised with her conscience by producing it and acting upon its terms which had been so stated as not to disclose the marriage this was now rendered impossible by her own impulsive act she could not mention the will at all without admitting that she had destroyed it

mrs carteret found herself in what might be called vulgarly a moral  pocket she could of course remain silent mrs carteret was a good woman according to her lights with a cultivated conscience to which she had always looked as her mentor and infallible guide

hence mrs carteret after this painful discovery remained for a long time ill at ease â so disturbed indeed that her mind reacted upon her nerves which had never been strong  and her nervousness affected her strength which had never been great until carteret whose love for her had been deepened and strengthened by the advent of his son became alarmed for her health and spoke very seriously to dr price concerning it

mrs carteret awoke with a start from a troubled dream she had been sailing across a sunlit sea in a beautiful boat her child lying on a brightcolored cushion at her feet overhead the swelling sail served as an awning to keep off the suns rays which far ahead were reflected with dazzling brilliancy from the shores of a golden island her son she  dreamed was a fairy prince and yonder lay his kingdom to which he was being borne lying there at her feet in this beautiful boat across the sunlit sea

suddenly and without warning the sky was overcast a squall struck the boat and tore away the sail in the distance a huge billow â a great white wall of water â came sweeping toward their frail craft threatening it with instant destruction she clasped her child to her bosom and a moment later found herself struggling in the sea holding the childs head above the water as she floated there as though sustained by some unseen force she saw in the distance a small boat approaching over the stormtossed waves straight toward her it came and she had reached out her hand to grasp its side when the rower looked back and she saw that it was her sister the recognition had been mutual with a sharp movement of one oar the boat glided by leaving her clutching at the empty air

she felt her strength begin to fail despairingly she signaled with her disengaged hand but the rower after one mute reproachful glance rowed on mrs carterets strength grew less and less the child became heavy as lead herself floating in the water as though it were her native element she could no longer support the child lower and lower it sank â she was powerless to save it or to accompany it â until gasping wildly for breath it threw up its little hands and sank the cruel water gurgling over its head â when she awoke with a start and a chill and lay there trembling for several minutes before she heard little dodie in his crib breathing heavily

she rose softly went to the crib and changed the childs position to an easier one he breathed more freely and she went back to bed but not to sleep

she had tried to put aside the distressing questions raised by the discovery of her fathers will and the papers accompanying it why should she be burdened with such a responsibility at this late day when the touch of time had wellnigh healed these old sores  surely god had put his curse not alone upon the slave but upon the stealer of men  with other good people she had thanked him that slavery was no more and that those who once had borne its burden upon their consciences could stand erect and feel that they themselves were free the weed had been cut down but its roots remained deeply imbedded in the soil to spring up and trouble a new generation upon her weak shoulders was placed the burden of her fathers weakness her fathers folly it was left to her to acknowledge or not this shameful marriage and her sisters rights in their fathers estate

balancing one consideration against another she had almost decided that she might ignore this tie to herself olivia merkell â olivia carteret â the stigma of base birth would have meant social ostracism social ruin the averted face the finger of pity or of scorn all the traditional weight of public disapproval would have fallen upon her as the unhappy fruit of an unblessed union to this other woman it could have had no such significance â it had been the lot of her race to them twentyfive years before sexual sin had never been imputed as more than a fault she had lost nothing by her supposed illegitimacy  she would gain nothing by the acknowledgment of her mothers marriage

on the other hand what would be the effect of this revelation upon mrs carteret herself to have it known that her father had married a negress would only be less dreadful than to have it appear that he had committed some terrible crime it was a crime now by the laws of every southern state for white and colored persons to intermarry she shuddered before the possibility that at some time in the future some person none too well informed might learn that her father had married a colored woman and might assume that she olivia carteret or her child had sprung from this shocking mesalliance â a fate to which she would willingly have preferred death no this marriage must never be made known the secret should remain buried forever in her own heart

but there still remained the question of her fathers property and her fathers will this woman was her fathers child â of that there could be no doubt it was written in her features no less than in her fathers will as his lawful child â of which alas  there could also be no question â she was entitled by law to half his estate mrs carterets problem had sunk from the realm of sentiment to that of material things which curiously enough she found much more difficult for while the negro by the traditions of her people was barred from the world of sentiment his rights of property were recognized the question had become with mrs carteret a question of meum and tuum had the girl janet been poor ignorant or degraded as might well have been her fate mrs carteret might have felt a vicarious remorse for her aunts suppression of the papers  but fate had compensated janet for the loss she had been educated she had married well she had not suffered for lack of the money of which she had been defrauded and did not need it now she had a child it is true but this childs career would be so circumscribed by the accident of color that too much wealth would only be a source of unhappiness to her own child on the contrary it would open every door of life

it would be too lengthy a task to follow the mind and conscience of this muchtried lady in their intricate workings upon this difficult problem for she had a mind as logical as any womans and a conscience which she wished to keep void of offense she had to confront a situation involving the element of race upon which the moral standards of her people were hopelessly confused mrs carteret reached the conclusion ere daylight dawned that she would be silent upon the subject of her fathers second marriage neither party had wished it known â neither julia nor her father â and she would respect her fathers wishes to act otherwise would be to defeat his will to make known what he had carefully concealed and to give janet a claim of title to one half her fathers estate while he had only meant her to have the ten thousand dollars named in the will

by the same reasoning she must carry out her fathers will in respect to this bequest here there was another difficulty the mining investment into which they had entered shortly after the birth of little dodie had tied up so much of her property that it would have been difficult to procure ten thousand dollars immediately  while a demand for half the property at once would mean bankruptcy and ruin moreover upon what ground could she offer her sister any sum of money whatever  so sudden a change of heart after so many years of silence would raise the presumption of some right on the part of janet in her fathers estate suspicion once aroused it might be possible to trace this hidden marriage and establish it by legal proof the marriage once verified the claim for half the estate could not be denied she could not plead her fathers will to the contrary for this would be to acknowledge the suppression of the will in itself a criminal act

there was however a way of escape this hospital which had recently been opened was the personal property of her sisters husband some time in the future when their investments matured she would present to the hospital a sum of money equal to the amount her father had meant his colored daughter to have thus indirectly both her fathers will and her own conscience would be satisfied

mrs carteret had reached this comfortable conclusion and was falling asleep when her attention was again drawn by her childs breathing she took it in her own arms and soon fell asleep

 by the way olivia said the major when leaving the house next morning for the office  if you have any business down town today transact it this forenoon under no circumstances must you or clara or the baby leave the house after midday

 why whats the matter phil  

 nothing to alarm you except that there may be a little political demonstration which may render the streets unsafe you are not to say anything about it where the servants might hear

 will there be any danger for you phil   she demanded with alarm

not the slightest olivia dear no one will be harmed but it is best for ladies and children to stay indoors

mrs carterets nerves were still more or less vanstrung from her mental struggles of the night and the memory of her dream came to her like a dim foreboding of misfortune as though in sympathy with its mothers feelings the baby did not seem as well as usual the new nurse was by no means an ideal nurse â mammy jane understood the child much better if there should be any trouble with the negroes toward which her husbands remark seemed to point â she knew the general political situation though not informed in regard to her husbands plans â she would like to have mammy jane near her where the old nurse might be protected from danger or alarm

with this end in view she dispatched the nurse shortly after breakfast to mammy janes house in the negro settlement on the other side of the town with a message asking the old woman to come immediately to mrs carterets unfortunately mammy jane had gone to visit a sick woman in the country and was not expected to return for several hours

the wellington riot began at three oclock in the afternoon of a day as fair as was ever selected for a deed of darkness the sky was clear except for a few light clouds that floated white and feathery high in air like distant islands in a sapphire sea a saltladen breeze from the ocean a few miles away lent a crisp sparkle to the air

at three oclock sharp the streets were filled as if by magic with armed white men the negroes going about had noted with uneasy curiosity that the stores and places of business many of which closed at noon were unduly late in opening for the afternoon though no one suspected the reason for the delay but at three oclock every passing colored man was ordered by the first white man he met to throw up his hands if he complied he was searched more or less roughly for firearms and then warned to get off the street when he met another group of white men the scene was repeated the man thus summarily held up seldom encountered more than two groups before disappearing across lots to his own home or some convenient hidingplace if he resisted any demand of those who halted himâ but the records of the day are historical they may be found in the newspapers of the following date but they are more firmly engraved upon the hearts and memories of the people of wellington for many months there were negro families in the town whose children screamed with fear and ran to their mothers for protection at the mere sight of a white man

dr miller had received a call about one oclock to attend a case at the house of a welltodo colored farmer who lived some three or four miles from the town upon the very road by the way along which miller had driven so furiously a few weeks before in the few hours that intervened before sandy campbell would probably have been burned at the stake the drive to his patients home the necessary inquiries the filling of the prescription from his own medicinecase which he carried along with him the little friendly conversation about the weather and the crops and the farmer being an intelligent and thinking man the inevitable subject of the future of their race â these added to the return journey occupied at least two hours of millers time

as he neared the town on his way back he saw ahead of him half a dozen men and women approaching with fear written in their faces in every degree from apprehension to terror women were weeping and children crying and all were going as fast as seemingly lay in their power looking behind now and then as if pursued by some deadly enemy at sight of millers buggy they made a dash for cover disappearing like a covey of frightened partridges in the underbrush along the road

miller pulled up his horse and looked after them in startled wonder

 what on earth can be the matter   he muttered struck with a vague feeling of alarm a psychologist seeking to trace the effects of slavery upon the human mind might find in the south many a curious illustration of this curse abiding long after the actual physical bondage had terminated in the olden time the white south labored under the constant fear of negro insurrections knowing that they themselves if in the negroes place would have risen in the effort to throw off the yoke all their reiterated theories of negro subordination and inferiority could not remove that lurking fear founded upon the obscure consciousness that the slaves ought to have risen conscience it has been said makes cowards of us all there was never on the continent of america a successful slave revolt nor one which lasted more than a few hours or resulted in the loss of more than a few white lives  yet never was the planter quite free from the fear that there might be one

on the other hand the slave had before his eyes always the fear of the master there were good men according to their lights â according to their training and environment â among the southern slaveholders who treated their slaves kindly as slaves from principle because they recognized the claims of humanity even under the dark skin of a human chattel there was many a one who protected or pampered his negroes as the case might be just as a man fondles his dog â because they were his  they were a part of his estate an integral part of the entity of property and person which made up the aristocrat but with all this kindness there was always present in the consciousness of the lowest slave the knowledge that he was in his masters power and that he could make no effectual protest against the abuse of that authority there was also the knowledge among those who could think at all that the best of masters was himself a slave to a system which hampered his movements but scarcely less than those of his bondmen

when therefore miller saw these men and women scampering into the bushes he divined with this slumbering race consciousness which years of culture had not obliterated that there was some race trouble on foot his intuition did not long remain unsupported a black head was cautiously protruded from the shrubbery and a black voice â if such a description be allowable â addressed him â  is dat you doctuh miller 

 yes who are you and whats the trouble  

 whats de trouble suh  why all hells broke loose in town yonduh de wite folks is riz gins de niggers an say deyre gwine ter kill evey nigger dey kin lay hans on

millers heart leaped to his throat as he thought of his wife and child this story was preposterous it could not be true and yet there must be something in it he tried to question his informant but the man was so overcome with excitement and fear that miller saw clearly that he must go farther for information he had read in the morning chronicle a few days before the obnoxious editorial quoted from the afroamerican banner and had noted the comment upon it by the white editor he had felt as at the time of its first publication that the editorial was illadvised it could do no good and was calculated to arouse the animosity of those whose friendship whose tolerance at least was necessary and almost indispensable to the colored people they were living at the best in a sort of armed neutrality with the whites  such a publication however serviceable elsewhere could have no other effect in wellington than to endanger this truce and defeat the hope of a possible future friendship the right of free speech entitled barber to publish it a larger measure of commonsense would have made him withhold it whether it was the republication of this article that had stirred up anew the sleeping dogs of race prejudice and whetted their thirst for blood he could not yet tell but at any rate there was mischief on foot

 fer gods sake doctuh don go no closeter ter dat town pleaded his informant  er youll be killt sho come on wid us suh an tek keer er yosef were gwine ter hide in de swamps till dis thing is over 

 god man   exclaimed miller urging his horse forward  my wife and child are in the town 

fortunately he reflected there were no patients confined in the hospital â if there should be anything in this preposterous story to one unfamiliar with southern life it might have seemed impossible that these good christian people who thronged the churches on sunday and wept over the sufferings of the lowly nazarene and sent missionaries to the heathen could be hungering and thirsting for the blood of their fellow men but miller cherished no such delusion he knew the history of his country he had the threatened lynching of sandy campbell vividly in mind  and he was fully persuaded that to race prejudice once roused any horror was possible that women or children would be molested of set purpose he did not believe but that they might suffer by accident was more than likely

as he neared the town dashing forward at the top of his horses speed he heard his voice called in a loud and agitated tone and glancing around him saw a familiar form standing by the roadside gesticulating vehemently

he drew up the horse with a suddenness that threw the faithful and obedient animal back upon its haunches the colored lawyer watson came up to the buggy that he was laboring under great and unusual excitement was quite apparent from his pale face and frightened air

 whats the matter watson   demanded miller hoping now to obtain some reliable information

 matter  exclaimed the other  everythings the matter the white people are up in arms they have disarmed the colored people killing half a dozen in the process and wounding as many more they have forced the mayor and aldermen to resign have formed a provisional city government a la francaise and have ordered me and half a dozen other fellows to leave town in fortyeight hours under pain of sudden death as they seem to mean it i shall not stay so long fortunately my wife and children are away i knew you were out here however and i thought id come out and wait for you so that we might talk the matter over i dont imagine they mean you any harm personally because you tread on nobodys toes but youre too valuable a man for the race to lose so i thought id give you warning i shall want to sell you my property too at a bargain for im worth too much to my family to dream of ever attempting to live here again

 have you seen anything of my wife and child   asked miller intent upon the danger to which they might be exposed

 no i didnt go to the house i inquired at the drugstore and found out where you had gone you neednt fear for them â it is not a war on women and children

 war of any kind is always hardest on the women and children returned miller  i must hurry on and see that mine are safe

 theyll not carry the war so far into africa as that returned watson  but i never saw anything like it yesterday i had a hundred white friends in the town or thought i had â men who spoke pleasantly to me on the street and sometimes gave me their hands to shake not one of them said to me today watson stay at home this afternoon i might have been killed like any one of half a dozen others who have bit the dust for any word that one of my  friends  had said to warn me when the race cry is started in this neck of the woods friendship religion humanity reason all shrivel up like dry leaves in a raging furnace

the buggy into which watson had climbed was meanwhile rapidly nearing the town

 i think ill leave you here miller said watson as they approached the outskirts  and make my way home by a roundabout path as i should like to get there unmolested home â a beautiful word that isnt it for an exiled wanderer  it might not be well either for us to be seen together if you put the hood of your buggy down and sit well back in the shadow you may be able to reach home without interruption  but avoid the main streets ill see you again this evening if were both alive and i can reach you for my time is short a committee are to call in the morning to escort me to the train i am to be dismissed from the community with public honors

watson was climbing down from the buggy when a small party of men were seen approaching and big josh green followed by several other resolutelooking colored men came up and addressed them

 dr miller cried green  mr watson â were lookin fer a leader de wite folks are killin de niggers an we ain gwine ter stan up an be shot down like dogs were gwine ter defen ou lives an we ain gwine ter run away fm no place where weve got a right ter be  an woe be ter de wite man wat lays hans on us deres two niggers in dis town ter evey wite man an ef we ve got ter be killt well take some wite folks long wid us ez sho ez deres a god in heaven â ez i spose dere is dough he mus be sleep er busy somewhar ese terday will youall come an lead us  

gentlemen said watson what is the use the negroes will not back you up they havent the arms nor the moral courage nor the leadership

well git de arms anwell git de courage ef youll come an lead us  we wants leaders â dats wy we come ter you  

 whats the use   returned watson despairingly  the odds are too heavy ive been ordered out of town  if i stayed id be shot on sight unless i had a bodyguard around me

well be yo bodyguard  shouted half a dozen voices

 and when my bodyguard was shot what then  i have a wife and children it is my duty to live for them if i died i should get no glory and no reward and my family would be reduced to beggary â to which theyll soon be near enough as it is this affair will blow over in a day or two the white people will be ashamed of themselves tomorrow and apprehensive of the consequences for some time to come keep quiet boys and trust in god you wont gain anything by resistance

  god heps dem dat heps demselves  returned josh stoutly ef mr watson wont lead us will you dr miller   said the spokesman turning to the doctor

for miller it was an agonizing moment he was no coward morally or physically every manly instinct urged him to go forward and take up the cause of these leaderless people and if need be to defend their lives and their rights with his own â but to what end 

listen men he said we would only be throwing our lives away suppose we made a determined stand and won a temporary victory by morning every train every boat every road leading into wellington would be crowded with white men â as they probably will be any way â with arms in their hands curses on their lips and vengeance in their hearts in the minds of those who make and administer the laws we have no standing in the court of conscience they would kill us in the fight or they would hang us afterwards â one way or another we should be doomed i should like to lead you i should like to arm every colored man in this town and have them stand firmly in line not for attack but for defense but if i attempted it and they should stand by me which is questionable â for i have met them fleeing from the town â my life would pay the forfeit alive i may be of some use to you and you are welcome to my life in that way â i am giving it freely dead i should be a mere lump of carrion

who remembers even the names of those who have been done to death in the southern states for the past twenty years  

imembers de name er one of em said josh  an imembers de name er de man dat killt im an i spec his time is mighty nigh come

 my advice is not heroic but i think it is wise in this riot we are placed as we should be in a war we have no territory no base of supplies no organization no outside sympathy â we stand in the position of a race in a case like this without money and without friends our time will come â the time when we can command respect for our rights  but it is not yet in sight give it up boys and wait good may come of this after all

several of the men wavered and looked irresolute

i reckon thats all so doctuh returned josh  an de way you put it i don blame you ner mr watson but all dem reasons ain got no weight wid me im gwine in dat town an ef any wite man sturbs me derell be trouble â derell be double trouble â i feels it in my bones  

 remember your old mother josh said miller

 yas suh ill member her dats all i kin do now i don need ter wait fer her no mo fer she died dis monin id lack ter see her buried suh but i may not have de chance ef i gits killt will you do me a favor  

yes josh  what is it 

 ef i should git laid out in dis commotion dats gwine on will you collec my wages fm yo brother and see dat de ole oman is put away right 

yes of course

 wid a nice coffin an a nice funeal an a headbod an a footbod  

 yes

 all right suh  ef i don live ter do it ill know itll be tended ter right now were gwine out ter de cotton compress an git a lot er colored men tergether an ef de wite folks sturbs me i shouldnt be sprise ef dered be a mixup  âan ef dere is me an one wite manll stan befo de jedgment thone er god dis day an it wont be me watll be feared er de jedgment come along boys dese gentlemen may have somethin ter live fer but ez fer my pat id ruther be a dead nigger any day dan a live dog  

the party under joshs leadership moved off down the road miller while entirely convinced that he had acted wisely in declining to accompany them was yet conscious of a distinct feeling of shame and envy that he too did not feel impelled to throw away his life in a hopeless struggle

watson left the buggy and disappeared by a path at the roadside miller drove rapidly forward after entering the town he passed several small parties of white men but escaped scrutiny by sitting well back in his buggy the presumption being that a welldressed man with a good horse and buggy was white torn with anxiety he reached home at about four oclock driving the horse into the yard he sprang down from the buggy and hastened to the house which he found locked front and rear

a repeated rapping brought no response at length he broke a window and entered the house like a thief

janet janet he called in alarm where are you  it is only i â will 

there was no reply he ran from room to room only to find them all empty again he called his wifes name and was about rushing from the house when a muffled voice came faintly to his ear â  is dat you doctuh miller 

 yes who are you and where are my wife and child

he was looking around in perplexity when the door of a low closet under the kitchen sink was opened from within and a woolly head was cautiously protruded

 are you sho dats you doctuh 

m yes sally where are  â  an not some wite man come ter bun down de house an kill all de niggers  

 no sally its me all right where is my wife  where is my child  

 dey went over ter see mis butler long bout two oclock befo dis fuss broke out suh oh lawdy lawdy suh is all de cullud folks ben killt cepn me an you suh fer de lawds sake suh you won let em kill me will you suh  ill wuk fer you fer nuthin suh all my bawn days ef youll save my life suh

 calm yourself sally youll be safe enough if you stay right here ive no doubt theyll not harm women â of that im sure enough although i havent yet got the bearings of this deplorable affair stay here and look after the house i must find my wife and child  

the distance across the city to the home of the mrs butler whom his wife had gone to visit was exactly one mile though miller had a good horse in front of him he was two hours in reaching his destination never will the picture of that ride fade from his memory in his dreams he repeats it night after night and sees the sights that wounded his eyes and feels the thoughts â the haunting spirits of the thoughts â that tore his heart as he rode through hell to find those whom he was seeking

for a short distance he saw nothing and made rapid progress as he turned the first corner his horse shied at the dead body of a negro lying huddled up in the collapse which marks sudden death what miller shuddered at was not so much the thought of death to the sight of which his profession had accustomed him as the suggestion of what it signified he had taken with allowance the wild statement of the fleeing fugitives watson too had been greatly excited and josh greens group were desperate men as much liable to be misled by their courage as the others by their fears but here was proof that murder had been done â and his wife and children were in the town distant shouts and the sound of firearms increased his alarm he struck his horse with the whip and dashed on toward the heart of the city which he must traverse in order to reach janet and the child

at the next corner lay the body of another man with the red blood oozing from a ghastly wound in the forehead the negroes seemed to have been killed as the band plays in circus parades at the street intersections where the example would be most effective miller with a wild leap of the heart had barely passed this gruesome spectacle when a sharp voice commanded him to halt and emphasized the order by covering him with a revolver forgetting the prudence he had preached to others he had raised his whip to strike the horse when several hands seized the bridle

 come down you damn fool growled an authoritative voice  dont you see were in earnest  do you want to get killed  

 why should i come down   asked miller

 because weve ordered you to come down  this is the white peoples day and when they order a nigger must obey were going to search you for weapons

 search away youll find nothing but a case of surgeons tools which im more than likely to need before this day is over from all indications

 no matter well make sure of it thats what were here for come down if you dont want to be pulled down 

miller stepped down from his buggy his interlocutor who made no effort at disguise was a clerk in a drygoods store where miller bought most of his family and hospital supplies he made no sign of recognition however and miller claimed no acquaintance this man who had for several years emptied millers pockets in the course of more or less legitimate trade now went through them aided by another man more rapidly than ever before the searchers convincing themselves that miller carried no deadly weapon upon his person meanwhile a third ransacked the buggy with like result miller recognized several others of the party who made not the slightest attempt at disguise though no names were called by any one

 where are you going   demanded the leader

 i am looking for my wife and child replied miller

 well run along and keep them out of the streets when you find them and keep your hands out of this affair if you wish to live in this town which from now on will be a white mans town as you niggers will be pretty firmly convinced before night

miller drove on as swiftly as might be

at the next corner he was stopped again in the white man who held him up miller recognized a neighbor of his own after a short detention and a perfunctory search the white man remarked apologetically â  sorry to have had to trouble you doctuh but thems the oders it aint men like you that were after but the vicious and criminal class of niggers

miller smiled bitterly as he urged his horse forward he was quite well aware that the virtuous citizen who had stopped him had only a few weeks before finished a term in the penitentiary to which he had been sentenced for stealing miller knew that he could have bought all the man owned for fifty dollars and his soul for as much more

a few rods farther on he came near running over the body of a wounded man who lay groaning by the wayside every professional instinct urged him to stop and offer aid to the sufferer but the uncertainty concerning his wife and child proved a stronger motive and urged him resistlessly forward here and there the ominous sound of firearms was audible he might have thought this merely a part of the show like the  powder play  of the arabs but for the bloody confirmation of its earnestness which had already assailed his vision somewhere in this seething caldron of unrestrained passions were his wife and child and he must hurry on

his progress was painfully slow three times he was stopped and searched more than once his way was barred and he was ordered to turn back each such occasion requiring a detour which consumed many minutes the man who last stopped him was a wellknown jewish merchant a jew â god of moses â had so far forgotten twenty centuries of history as to join in the persecution of another oppressed race when almost reduced to despair by these innumerable delays he perceived coming toward him mr ellis the subeditor of the morning chronicle miller had just been stopped and questioned again and ellis came up as he was starting once more upon his endless ride

 dr miller said ellis kindly  it is dangerous for you on the streets why tempt the danger  

 i am looking for my wife and child returned miller in desperation  they are somewhere in this town â  dont know whereâand i must find them

ellis had been horrorstricken by the tragedy of the afternoon the wholly superfluous slaughter of a harmless people whom a show of force would have been quite sufficient to overawe elaborate explanations were afterwards given for these murders which were said perhaps truthfully not to have been premeditated and many regrets were expressed the young man had been surprised quite as much as the negroes themselves at the ferocity displayed his own thoughts and feelings were attuned to anything but slaughter only that morning he had received a perfumed note calling his attention to what the writer described as a very noble deed of his and requesting him to call that evening and receive the writers thanks had he known that miss pemberton several weeks after their visit to the sound had driven out again to the hotel and made some inquiries among the servants he might have understood better the meaning of this missive when miller spoke of his wife and child some subtle thread of suggestion coupled the note with millers plight

 ill go with you dr miller he said  if youll permit me in my company you will not be disturbed

he took a seat in millers buggy after which it was not molested

neither of them spoke miller was sick at heart he could have wept with grief even had the welfare of his own dear ones not been involved in this regrettable affair with prophetic instinct he foresaw the hatreds to which this day would give birth the long years of constraint and distrust which would still further widen the breach between two peoples whom fate had thrown together in one community

there was nothing for ellis to say in his heart he could not defend the deeds of this day the petty annoyances which the whites had felt at the spectacle of a few negroes in office the not unnatural resentment of a proud people at what had seemed to them a presumptuous freedom of speech and lack of deference on the part of their inferiors â these things which he knew were to be made the excuse for overturning the city government he realized full well were no sort of justification for the wholesale murder or other horrors which might well ensue before the day was done he could not approve the acts of his own people neither could he to a negro condemn them hence he was silent

 thank you mr ellis exclaimed miller when they had reached the house where he expected to find his wife  this is the place where i was going i am â under a great obligation to you

 not at all dr miller i need not tell you how much i regret this deplorable affair

ellis went back down the street fastening his horse to the fence miller sprang forward to find his wife and child they would certainly be there for no colored woman would be foolhardy enough to venture on the streets after the riot had broken out

as he drew nearer he felt a sudden apprehension the house seemed strangely silent and deserted the doors were closed and the venetian blinds shut tightly even a dog which had appeared slunk timidly back under the house instead of barking vociferously according to the usual habit of his kind

miller knocked at the door there was no response he went round to the rear of the house the dog had slunk behind the woodpile miller knocked again at the back door and receiving no reply called aloud

 mrs butler it is i dr miller is my wife here

the slats of a nearby blind opened cautiously

 is it really you dr miller  

 yes mrs butler i am looking for my wife and child â are they here  

no sir she became alarmed about you soon after the shooting commenced and i could not keep her she left for home half an hour ago it is coming on dusk and she and the child are so near white that she did not expect to be molested

 which way did she go  

 she meant to go by the main street she thought it would be less dangerous than the back streets i tried to get her to stay here but she was frantic about you and nothing i could say would keep her is the riot almost over dr miller do you think they will murder us all and burn down our houses  

 god knows replied miller with a groan  but i must find her if i lose my own life in the attempt

surely he thought janet would be safe the white people of wellington were not savages or at least their temporary reversion to savagery would not go as far as to include violence to delicate women and children then there flashed into his mind josh greens story of his  silly  mother who for twenty years had walked the earth as a child as the result of one nights terror and his heart sank within him

miller realized that his buggy by attracting attention had been a hindrance rather than a help in his progress across the city in order to follow his wife he must practically retrace his steps over the very route he had come night was falling it would be easier to cross the town on foot in the dusk his own color slight in the daytime would not attract attention and by dodging in the shadows he might avoid those who might wish to intercept him but he must reach janet and the boy at any risk he had not been willing to throw his life away hopelessly but he would cheerfully have sacrificed it for those whom he loved

he had gone but a short distance and had not yet reached the centre of mob activity when he intercepted a band of negro laborers from the cotton compress with big josh green at their head

hello doctuh  cried josh does you wan ter jine us  

 im looking for my wife and child josh theyre somewhere in this den of murderers have any of you seen them  

no one had seen them

 you men are running a great risk said miller you are rushing on to certain death

 well suh maybe we is but were gwine ter die fightin dey say de wite folks is gwine ter bun all de cullud schools an chuches an kill all de niggers dey kin ketch deyre gwine ter bun yo new hospittle ef somebody don stop em

 josh â men â you are throwing your lives away it is a fever it will wear off tomorrow or tonight theyll not burn the schoolhouses nor the hospital â they are not such fools for they benefit the community  and theyll only kill the colored people who resist them every one of you with a gun or a pistol carries his death warrant in his own hand id rather see the hospital burn than have one of you lose his life resistance only makes the matter worse â the odds against you are too long

 things cant be any wuss doctuh replied one of the crowd sturdily  a gun is mo dangeous ter de man in front of it dan ter de man bellin it deyre gwine ter kill us anyhow an were tired â we read de newspapersâan were tired er bein shot down like dogs widout jedge er jury wed ruther die fightin dan be stuck like pigs in a pen  

 god help you  said miller  as for me i must find my wife and child

 goodby doctuh cried josh brandishing a huge knife  member bout de ole oman ef you lives thoo dis don fergit de headbod an de footbod an a silver plate on de coffin ef deres money ernuff they went their way and miller hurried on they might resist attack he thought it extremely unlikely that they would begin it but he knew perfectly well that the mere knowledge that some of the negroes contemplated resistance would only further inflame the infuriated whites the colored men might win a momentary victory though it was extremely doubtful and they would as surely reap the harvest later on the qualities which in a white man would win the applause of the world would in a negro be taken as the marks of savagery so thoroughly diseased was public opinion in matters of race that the negro who died for the common rights of humanity might look for no meed of admiration or glory at such a time in the white mans eyes a negros courage would be mere desperation  his love of liberty a mere animal dislike of restraint every finer human instinct would be interpreted in terms of savagery or if forced to admire they would none the less repress they would applaud his courage while they stretched his neck or carried off the fragments of his mangled body as souvenirs in much the same way that savages preserve the scalps or eat the hearts of their enemies

but concern for the fate of josh and his friends occupied only a secondary place in millers mind for the moment his wife and child were somewhere ahead of him he pushed on he had covered about a quarter of a mile more and far down the street could see the signs of greater animation when he came upon the body of a woman lying upon the sidewalk in the dusk he had almost stumbled over it and his heart came up in his mouth a second glance revealed that it could not be his wife it was a fearful portent however of what her fate might be the  war  had reached the women and children yielding to a professional instinct he stooped and saw that the prostrate form was that of old aunt jane letlow she was not yet quite dead and as miller with a tender touch placed her head in a more comfortable position her lips moved with a last lingering flicker of consciousness â  comin missis comin 

mammy jane had gone to join the old mistress upon whose memory her heart was fixed and yet not all her reverence for her old mistress nor all her deference to the whites nor all their friendship for her had been able to save her from this raging devil of race hatred which momentarily possessed the town

perceiving that he could do no good miller hastened onward sick at heart whenever he saw a party of white men approaching â these brave reformers never went singly â he sought concealment in the shadow of a tree or the shrubbery in some yard until they had passed he had covered about two thirds of the distance homeward when his eyes fell upon a group beneath a lamppost at sight of which he turned pale with horror and rushed forward with a terrible cry

the proceedings of the day â planned originally as a  demonstration dignified subsequently as a  revolution under any name the culmination of the conspiracy formed by carteret and his colleagues â had by seven oclock in the afternoon developed into a murderous riot crowds of white men and halfgrown boys drunk with whiskey or with license raged through the streets beating chasing or killing any negro so unfortunate as to fall into their hands why any particular negro was assailed no one stopped to inquire it was merely a white mob thirsting for black blood with no more conscience or discrimination than would be exercised by a wolf in a sheepfold it was race against race the whites against the negroes and it was a onesided affair for until josh green got together his body of armed men no effective resistance had been made by any colored person and the individuals who had been killed had so far left no marks upon the enemy by which they might be remembered

 kill the niggers  rang out now and then through the dusk and far down the street and along the intersecting thoroughfares distant voices took up the ominous refrain â  kill the niggers kill the damned niggers  

now not a dark face had been seen on the street for half an hour until the group of men headed by josh made their appearance in the negro quarter armed with guns and axes they presented quite a formidable appearance as they made their way toward the new hospital near which stood a schoolhouse and a large church both used by the colored people they did not reach their destination without having met a number of white men singly or in twos or threes and the rumor spread with incredible swiftness that the negroes in turn were up in arms determined to massacre all the whites and burn the town some of the whites became alarmed and recognizing the power of the negroes if armed and conscious of their strength were impressed by the immediate necessity of overpowering and overawing them others with appetites already whetted by slaughter saw a chance welcome rather than not of shedding more black blood spontaneously the white mob flocked toward the hospital where rumor had it that a large body of desperate negroes breathing threats of blood and fire had taken a determined stand

it had been joshs plan merely to remain quietly and peaceably in the neighborhood of the little group of public institutions molesting no one unless first attacked and merely letting the white people see that they meant to protect their own but so rapidly did the rumor spread and so promptly did the white people act that by the time josh and his supporters had reached the top of the rising ground where the hospital stood a crowd of white men much more numerous than their own party were following them at a short distance

josh with the eye of a general perceived that some of his party were becoming a little nervous and decided that they would feel safer behind shelter

 i reckon we better go inside de hospittle hoys he exclaimed  den well be behind brick walls an dem other fellowsll be outside an ef deres any fightin well have de bes show we ain gwine ter do no shootin till were pestered an deyll be less likely ter pester us ef dey cant git at us widout runnin some resk come along iu be men de govner er de president is gwine ter sen soldiers ter stop dese gwineson an meantime we kin keep dem white devils fm bunin down our hospittles an chuchhouses wen dey comes an fins out dat we jes means ter perfect ou propety deyll go long bout deir own business er ef dey wants a scrap dey kin have it come erlong boys 

jerry letlow who had kept out of sight during the day had started out after night had set in to find major carteret jerry was very much afraid the events of the day had filled him with terror whatever the limitations of jerrys mind or character may have been jerry had a keen appreciation of the danger to the negroes when they came in conflict with the whites and he had no desire to imperil his own skin he valued his life for his own sake and not for any altruistic theory that it might be of service to others in other words jerry was something of a coward he had kept in hiding all day but finding toward evening that the riot did not abate and fearing from the rumors which came to his ears that all the negroes would be exterminated he had set out somewhat desperately to try to find his white patron and protector he had been cautious to avoid meeting any white men and anticipating no danger from those of his own race went toward the party which he saw approaching whose path would cross his own when they were only a few yards apart josh took a step forward and caught jerry by the arm

 come along jerry we need you heres another man boys come on now and fight fer yo race 

in vain jerry protested  i don wan ter fight he howled de wite folks ain gwine ter pester me deyre my friens tun me loose â tun me loose er we all gwine ter git killed 

the party paid no attention to jerrys protestations indeed with the crowd of whites following behind they were simply considering the question of a position from which they could most effectively defend themselves and the building which they imagined to be threatened if josh had released his grip of jerry that worthy could easily have escaped from the crowd but josh maintained his hold almost mechanically and in the confusion jerry found himself swept with the rest into the hospital the doors of which were promptly barricaded with the heavier pieces of furniture and the windows manned by several men each josh with the instinct of a born commander posting his forces so that they could cover with their guns all the approaches to the building jerry still continuing to make himself troublesome josh in a moment of impatience gave him a terrific box on the ear which stretched him out upon the floor unconscious

 shet up he said   ef you cant stan up like a man keep still and dont interfere wid men wat will fight

the hospital when josh and his men took possession had been found deserted fortunately there were no patients for that day except one or two convalescents and these with the attendants had joined the exodus of the colored people from the town

a white man advanced from the crowd without toward the main entrance to the hospital big josh looking out from a window grasped his gun more firmly as his eyes fell upon the man who had murdered his father and darkened his mothers life mechanically he raised his rifle but lowered it as the white man lifted up his hand as a sign that he wished to speak

 you niggers called captain mc bane loudlyâ it was that worthy â  you niggers are courtin death an you wont have to court her but a minute er two mo befo syoull have you if you surrender and give up your arms youll be dealt with leniently â you may get off with the chaingang or thepenitentiary if you resist youll be shot like dogs

 dats no news mr white man replied josh appearing boldly at the window  were use ter bein treated like dogs by men like you if you wite people will go long an ten ter yo own business an let us alone well ten ter oun youve got guns an weve got jest as much right ter carry em as you have lay down yon an well lay down oun â we did n take em up fust but we ain gwine ter let you bun down ou chuches an schoolouses er dis hospittle an we ain comin out er dis house where we ain disturbin nobody fer you ter shoot us down er sen us ter jail you hear me  

 all right responded mc bane  youve had fair warning your blood be on your  â his speech was interrupted by a shot from the crowd which splintered the windowcasing close to joshs head this was followed by half a dozen other shots which were replied to almost simultaneously by a volley from within by which one of the attacking party was killed and another wounded

this roused the mob to frenzy

 vengeance  vengeance   they yelled  kill the niggers 

a negro had killed a white man â the unpardonable sin admitting neither excuse justification nor extenuation from time immemorial it had been bred in the southern white consciousness and in the negro consciousness also for that matter that the person of a white man was sacred from the touch of a negro no matter what the provocation a dozen colored men lay dead in the streets of wellington inoffensive people slain in cold blood because they had been bold enough to question the authority of those who had assailed them or frightened enough to flee when they had been ordered to stand still but their lives counted nothing against that of a riotous white man who had courted death by attacking a body of armed men

the crowd too surrounding the hospital had changed somewhat in character the men who had acted as leaders in the early afternoon having accomplished their purpose of overturning the local administration and establishing a provisional government of their own had withdrawn from active participation in the rioting deeming the negroes already sufficiently overawed to render unlikely any further trouble from that source several of the ringleaders had indeed begun to exert themselves to prevent further disorder or any loss of property the possibility of which had become apparent but those who set in motion the forces of evil cannot always control them afterwards the baser element of the white population recruited from the wharves and the saloons was now predominant

captain mc bane was the only one of the revolutionary committee who had remained with the mob not with any purpose to restore or preserve order but because he found the company and the occasion entirely congenial he had had no opportunity at least no tenable excuse to kill or maim a negro since the termination of his contract with the state for convicts and this occasion had awakened a dormant appetite for these diversions we are all puppets in the hands of tate and seldom see the strings that move us mc bane had lived a life of violence and cruelty as a man sows so shall he reap in works of fiction such men are sometimes converted more often in real life they do not change their natures until they are converted into dust one does well to distrust a tamed tiger

on the outskirts of the crowd a few of the better class or at least of the better clad were looking on the double volley described had already been fired when the number of these was augmented by the arrival of major carteret and mr ellis who had just come from the chronicle office where the next days paper had been in hasty preparation they pushed their way towards the front of the crowd

 this must be stopped ellis said carteret  they are burning houses and killing women and children old jane good old mammy jane who nursed my wife at her bosom and has waited on her and my child within a few weeks was killed only a few rods from my house to which she was evidently fleeing for protection it must have been by accident â i cannot believe that any white man in town would be dastard enough to commit such a deed intentionally  i would have defended her with my own life we must try to stop this thing  

 easier said than done returned ellis  it is in the fever stage and must burn itself out we shall be lucky if it does not burn the town out suppose the negroes should also take a hand at the burning  we have advised the people to put the negroes down and they are doing the job thoroughly

 my god   replied the other with a gesture of impatience as he continued to elbow his way through the crowd  i meant to keep them in their places â i did not intend wholesale murder and arson carteret having reached the front of the mob made an effort to gain their attention

 gentlemen  he cried in his loudest tones his voice unfortunately was neither loud nor piercing

 kill the niggers   clamored the mob

 gentlemen i implore you  â the crash of a dozen windows broken by stones and pistol shots drowned his voice

 gentlemen   he shouted   this is murder it is madness  it is a disgrace to our city to our state to our civilization 

 thats right  replied several voices the mob had recognized the speaker  it is a disgrace and well not put up with it a moment longer burn em out hurrah for major carteret the champion of  white supremacy  three cheers for the morning chronicle and  no nigger domination   

 hurrah hurrah hurrah  yelled the crowd

in vain the baffled orator gesticulated and shrieked in the effort to correct the misapprehension their oracle had spoken not hearing what he said they assumed it to mean encouragement and cooperation their present course was but the logical outcome of the crusade which the morning chronicle had preached in season and out of season for many months when carteret had spoken and the crowd had cheered him they felt that they had done all that courtesy required and he was goodnaturedly elbowed aside while they proceeded with the work in hand which was now to drive out the negroes from the hospital and avenge the killing of their comrade

some brought hay some kerosene and others wood from a pile which had been thrown into a vacant lot near by several safe ways of approach to the building were discovered and the combustibles placed and fired the flames soon gaining a foothold leaped upward catching here and there at the exposed woodwork and licking the walls hungrily with long tongues of flame

meanwhile a desultory firing was kept up from the outside which was replied to scatteringly from within the hospital those inside were either not good marksmen or excitement had spoiled their aim if a face appeared at a window a dozen pistol shots from the crowd sought the spot immediately

higher and higher leaped the flames suddenly from one of the windows sprang a black figure waving a white handkerchief it was jerry letlow regaining consciousness after the effect of joshs blow had subsided jerry had kept quiet and watched his opportunity from a safe vantageground he had scanned the crowd without in search of some white friend when he saw major carteret moving disconsolately away after his futile effort to stem the torrent jerry made a dash for the window he sprang forth and waving his handkerchief as a flag of truce ran toward major carteret shouting frantically  â  majah carteret â o majah  its me suh jerry suh  i did n go in dere mysef suh â i wuz drag in dere  i would n do nothin ginst de wite folks sub â no ndeed i would n suh 

jerrys cries were drowned in a roar of rage and a volley of shots from the mob carteret who had turned away with ellis did not even hear his servants voice jerrys poor flag of truce his explanations his reliance upon his white friends all failed him in the moment of supreme need in that hour as in any hour when the depths of race hatred are stirred a negro was no more than a brute beast set upon by other brute beasts whose only instinct was to kill and destroy

let us leave this inferno ellis said carteret sick with anger and disgust he had just become aware that a negro was being killed though he did not know whom we can do nothing the negroes have themselves to blame â they tempted us beyond endurance i counseled firmness and firm measures were taken and our purpose was accomplished i am not responsible for these subsequent horrors â i wash my hands of them let us go 

the flames gained headway and gradually enveloped the burning building until it became evident to those within as well as those without that the position of the defenders was no longer tenable would they die in the flames or would they be driven out  the uncertainty soon came to an end

the besieged had been willing to fight so long as there seemed a hope of successfully defending themselves and their property for their purpose was purely one of defense when they saw the case was hopeless inspired by josh greens reckless courage they were still willing to sell their lives dearly one or two of them had already been killed and as many more disabled the fate of jerry letlow had struck terror to the hearts of several others who could scarcely hide their fear after the building had been fired joshs exhortations were no longer able to keep them in the hospital they preferred to fight and be killed in the open rather than to be smothered like rats in a hole

boys   exclaimed josh â  men  âfer nobody but men would do wat you have done â the day has gone ginst us we kin see ou finish but fer my part i ain gwine ter leave dis worl widout takin a wite man long wid me an i sees my man right out yonder waitin â i ben waitin fer him twenty years but he won have ter wait fer me mo n bout twenty seconds evey one er you pick yo man well open de do an well give some wite men a chance ter be sorry dey ever started dis fuss 

the door was thrown open suddenly and through it rushed a dozen or more black figures armed with knives pistols or clubbed muskets taken by sudden surprise the white people stood motionless for a moment but the approaching negroes had scarcely covered half the distance to which the heat of the flames had driven back the mob before they were greeted with a volley that laid them all low but two one of these dazed by the fate of his companions turned instinctively to flee but had scarcely faced around before he fell pierced in the back by a dozen bullets

josh green the tallest and biggest of them all had not apparently been touched some of the crowd paused in involuntary admiration of this black giant famed on the wharves for his strength sweeping down upon them a smile upon his face his eyes lit up with a rapt expression which seemed to take him out of mortal ken this impression was heightened by his apparent immunity from the shower of lead which less susceptible persons had continued to pour at him

armed with a huge bowieknife a relic of the civil war which he had carried on his person for many years for a definite purpose and which he had kept sharpened to a razor edge he reached the line of the crowd all but the bravest shrank back like a wedge he dashed through the mob which parted instinctively before him and all oblivious of the rain of lead which fell around him reached the point where captain mc bane the bravest man in the party stood waiting to meet him a pistolflame flashed in his face but he went on and raising his powerful right arm buried his knife to the hilt in the heart of his enemy when the crowd dashed forward to wreak vengeance on his dead body they found him with a smile still upon his face

one of the two died as the fool dieth which was it or was it both   vengeance is mine saith the lord and it had not been left to him but they that do violence must expect to suffer violence mc banes death was merciful compared with the nameless horrors he had heaped upon the hundreds of helpless mortals who had fallen into his hands during his career as a contractor of convict labor

sobered by this culminating tragedy the mob shortly afterwards dispersed the flames soon completed their work and this handsome structure the fruit of old adam millers industry the monument of his sons philanthropy a promise of good things for the future of the city lay smouldering in ruins a melancholy witness to the fact that our boasted civilization is but a thin veneer which cracks and scales off at the first impact of primal passions

by the light of the burning building which illuminated the street for several blocks major carteret and ellis made their way rapidly until they turned into the street where the major lived reaching the house carteret tried the door and found it locked a vigorous ring at the bell brought no immediate response carteret had begun to pound impatiently upon the door when it was cautiously opened by miss pemberton who was pale and trembled with excitement

 where is olivia  asked the major

 she is upstairs with dodie and mrs albrights hospital nurse dodie has the croup virgie ran away after the riot broke out sister olivia had sent for mammy jane but she did not come mrs albright let her white nurse come over

 ill go up at once said the major anxiously  wait for me ellis â ill be down in a few minutes  oh mr ellis exclaimed clara coming toward him with both hands extended  can nothing be done to stop this terrible affair  

 i wish i could do something he murmured fervently taking both her trembling hands in his own broad palms where they rested with a surrendering trustfulness which he has never since had occasion to doubt  it has gone too far already and the end i fear is not yet but it cannot grow much worse

the editor hurried upstairs mrs carteret wearing a worried and haggard look met him at the threshold of the nursery

 dodie is ill she said  at three oclock when the trouble began i was over at mrs albrights â i had left virgie with the baby when i came back she and all the other servants had gone they had heard that the white people were going to kill all the negroes and fled to seek safety i found dodie lying in a draught before an open window gasping for breath i ran back to mrs albrights â i had found her much better today â and she let her nurse come over the nurse says that dodie is threatened with membranous croup

 have you sent for dr price  

 there was no one to send â the servants were gone and the nurse was afraid to venture out into the street i telephoned for dr price and found that he was out of town  that he had gone up the river this morning to attend a patient and would not be back until tomorrow mrs price thought that he had anticipated some kind of trouble in the town today and had preferred to be where he could not be called upon to assume any responsibility

 i suppose you tried dr ashe  

 i could not get him nor any one else after that first call the telephone service is disorganized on account of the riot we need medicine and ice the drugstores are all closed on account of the riot and for the same reason we couldnt get any ice

major carteret stood beside the brass bedstead upon which his child was lying â his only child around whose curly head clustered all his hopes upon whom all his life for the past year had been centred he stooped over the bed beside which the nurse had stationed herself she was wiping the childs face which was red and swollen and covered with moisture the nostrils working rapidly and the little patient vainly endeavoring at intervals to cough up the obstruction to his breathing

 is it serious   he inquired anxiously he had always thought of the croup as a childish ailment that yielded readily to proper treatment but the childs evident distress impressed him with sudden fear

 dangerous replied the young woman laconically you came none too soon if a doctor isnt got at once the child will die â and it must be a good doctor

 whom can i call   he asked  you know them all i suppose dr price our family physician is out of town

 dr ashe has charge of his cases when he is away replied the nurse  if you cant find him try dr hooper the child is growing worse every minute on your way back youd better get some ice if possible

the major hastened downstairs

dont wait for me ellis he said i shall be needed here for a while ill get to the office as soon as possible make up the paper and leave another stick out for me to the last minute but fill it up in case im not on hand by twelve we must get the paper out early in the morning

nothing but a matter of the most vital importance would have kept major carteret away from his office this night upon the presentation to the outer world of the story of this riot would depend the attitude of the great civilized public toward the events of the last ten hours the chronicle was the source from which the first word would be expected it would give the people of wellington their cue as to the position which they must take in regard to this distressful affair which had so far transcended in ferocity the most extreme measures which the conspirators had anticipated the burden of his own responsibility weighed heavily upon him and could not be shaken off but he must do first the duty nearest to him â he must first attend to his child

carteret hastened from the house and traversed rapidly the short distance to dr ashes office far down the street he could see the glow of the burning hospital and he had scarcely left his own house when the fusillade of shots fired when the colored men emerged from the burning building was audible carteret would have hastened back to the scene of the riot to see what was now going on and to make another effort to stem the tide of bloodshed but before the dread of losing his child all other interests fell into the background not all the negroes in wellington could weigh in the balance for one instant against the life of the feeble child now gasping for breath in the house behind him

reaching the house a vigorous ring brought the doctors wife to the door

 good  evening mrs ashe is the doctor at home

 no major carteret he was called to attend mrs wells who was taken suddenly ill as a result of the trouble this afternoon he will be there all night no doubt

 my child is very ill and i must find some one

 try dr yates his house is only four doors away

a ring at hr yatess door brought out a young man

 is dr yates in  

 yes sir

 can i see him 

you might see him sir hut that would be all his horse was frightened by the shooting on the streets and ran away and threw the doctor and broke his right arm i have just set it he will not be able to attend any patients for several weeks he is old and nervous and the shock was great

 are you not a physician   asked carteret looking at the young man keenly he was a serious gentlemanly looking young fellow whose word might probably be trusted

yes i am dr evans dr yatess assistant im really little more than a student but ill do what i can

 my only child is sick with the croup and requires immediate attention

 i ought to be able to handle a case of the croup answered dr evans  at least in the first stages ill go with you and stay by the child and if the case is beyond me i may keep it in check until another physician comes

he stepped back into another room and returning immediately with his hat accompanied carteret homeward the riot had subsided  even the glow from the smouldering hospital was no longer visible it seemed that the city appalled at the tragedy had suddenly awakened to a sense of its own crime here and there a dark face emerging cautiously from some hidingplace peered from behind fence or tree but shrank hastily away at the sight of a white face the negroes of wellington with the exception of josh green and his party had not behaved bravely on this critical day in their history but those who had fought were dead to the last man those who had sought safety in flight or concealment were alive to tell the tale

we pass right by dr thompsons said dr evans  if you havent spoken to him it might be well to call him for consultation in case the child should be very bad

 go on ahead said carteret  and ill get him

evans hastened on while carteret sounded the oldfashioned knocker upon the doctors door a grayhaired negro servant clad in a dress suit and wearing a white tie came to the door

 de doctuh suh he replied politely to carterets question  has gone ter ampitate de ahm er a genteman who got one er his bones smashed wid a pistol bullet in deâfightin dis afternoon suh hes jes gone suh an lef wod dat hed be gone a hour er mo suh

carteret hastened homeward he could think of no other available physician perhaps no other would be needed but if so he could find out from evans whom it was best to call

when he reached the childs room the young doctor was bending anxiously over the little frame the little lips had become livid the little nails lying against the white sheet were blue the childs efforts to breathe were most distressing and each gasp cut the father like a knife mrs carteret was weeping hysterically

 how is he doctor   asked the major

 he is very low replied the young man  nothing short of tracheotomy â an operation to open the windpipe â will relieve him without it in half or three quarters of an hour he will be unable to breathe it is a delicate operation a mistake in which would be as fatal as the disease i have neither the knowledge nor the experience to attempt it and your childs life is too valuable for a student to practice upon neither have i the instruments here

 what shall we do   demanded carteret  we have called all the best doctors and none are available

the young doctors brow was wrinkled with thought he knew a doctor who could perform the operation he had heard also of a certain event at carterets house some months before when an unwelcome physician had been excluded from a consultation â but it was the last chance

 there is but one other doctor in town who has performed the operation so far as i know he declared  and that is dr miller if you can get him he can save your childs life

carteret hesitated involuntarily all the incidents all the arguments of the occasion when he had refused to admit the colored doctor to his house came up vividly before his memory he had acted in accordance with his lifelong beliefs and had carried his point but the present situation was differentâ this was a case of imperative necessity and every other interest or consideration must give way before the imminence of his childs peril that the doctor would refuse the call he did not imagine it would be too great an honor for a negro to decline â unless some bitterness might have grown out of the proceedings of the afternoon that this doctor was a man of some education he knew and he had been told that he was a man of fine feeling â for a negro â and might easily have taken to heart the days events nevertheless he could hardly refuse a professional call â professional ethics would require him to respond carteret had no reason to suppose that miller had ever learned of what had occurred at the house during dr burnss visit to wellington the major himself had never mentioned the controversy and no doubt the other gentlemen had been equally silent

 ill go for him myself said dr evans noting carterets hesitation and suspecting its cause  i can do nothing here alone for a little while and i may be able to bring the doctor back with me he likes a difficult operation

it seemed an age ere the young doctor returned though it was really only a few minutes the nurse did what she could to relieve the childs sufferings which grew visibly more and more acute the mother upon the other side of the bed held one of the babys hands in her own and controlled her feelings as best she might carteret paced the floor anxiously going every few seconds to the head of the stairs to listen for evanss footsteps on the piazza without at last the welcome sound was audible and a few strides took him to the door

 dr miller is at home sir reported evans as he came in  he says that he was called to your house once before by a third person who claimed authority to act and that he was refused admittance he dedares that he will not consider such a call unless it come from you personally

that is true quite true replied carteret  his position is a just one i will go at once will â will â my child live until i can get miller here  

 he can live for half an hour without an operation beyond that i could give you little hope seizing his hat carteret dashed out of the yard and ran rapidly to millers house  ordinarily a walk of six or seven minutes carteret covered it in three and was almost out of breath when he rang the bell of millers front door

the ring was answered by the doctor in person

 dr miller i believe   asked carteret

 yes sir

 i am major carteret my child is seriously ill and you are the only available doctor who can perform the necessary operation

 ah  you have tried all the others â and then you come to me 

 yes i do not deny it admitted the major biting his lip he had not counted on professional jealousy as an obstacle to be met  but i have come to you as a physician to engage your professional services for my child â my only child i have confidence in your skill or i should not have come to you i request â nay i implore you to lose no more time but come with me at once  my childs life is hanging by a thread and you can save it 

 ah  replied the other as a father whose only childs life is in danger you implore me of all men in the world to come and save it 

there was a strained intensity in the doctors low voice that struck carteret in spite of his own preoccupation he thought he heard too from the adjoining room the sound of some one sobbing softly there was some mystery here which he could not fathom unaided

miller turned to the door behind him and threw it open on the white cover of a low cot lay a childish form in the rigidity of death and by it knelt with her back to the door a woman whose shoulders were shaken by the violence of her sobs absorbed in her grief she did not turn or give any sign that she had recognized the intrusion

 there major carteret  exclaimed miller with the tragic eloquence of despair  there lies a specimen of your handiwork  there lies my only child laid low by a stray bullet in this riot which you and your paper have fomented struck down as much by your hand as though you had held the weapon with which his life was taken 

 my god   exclaimed carteret struck with horror  is the child dead  

 there he lies continued the other  an innocent child â there he lies dead his little life snuffed out like a candle because you and a handful of your friends thought you must override the laws and run this town at any cost â and there kneels his mother overcome by grief we are alone in the house it is not safe to leave her unattended my duty calls me here by the side of my dead child and my suffering wife i cannot go with you there is a just god in heaven â as you have sown so may you reap 

carteret possessed a narrow but a logical mind and except when confused or blinded by his prejudices had always tried to be a just man in the agony of his own predicament â in the horror of the situation at millers house â for a moment the veil of race prejudice was rent in twain and he saw things as they were in their correct proportions and relations â saw clearly and convincingly that he had no standing here in the presence of death in the home of this stricken family millers refusal to go with him was pure elemental justice he could not blame the doctor for his stand he was indeed conscious of a certain involuntary admiration for a man who held in his hands the power of life and death and could use it with strict justice to avenge his own wrongs in dr millers place he would have done the same thing miller had spoken the truth â as he had sown so must he reap he could not expect could not ask this father to leave his own household at such a moment

pressing his lips together with grim courage and bowing mechanically as though to fate rather than the physician carteret turned and left the house at a rapid pace he soon reached home there was yet a chance for his child perhaps some one of the other doctors had come perhaps after all the disease had taken a favorable turn â evans was but a young doctor and might have been mistaken surely with doctors all around him his child would not be permitted to die for lack of medical attention  he found the mother the doctor and the nurse still grouped as he had left them around the suffering child

 how is he now   he asked in a voice that sounded like a groan

 no better replied the doctor   steadily growing worse he can go on probably for twenty minutes longer without an operation

 where is the doctor   demanded mrs carteret looking eagerly toward the door you should have brought him right upstairs theres not a minute to spare  phil phil our child will die 

carterets heart swelled almost to bursting with an intense pity even his own great sorrow became of secondary importance beside the grief which his wife must soon feel at the inevitable loss of her only child and it was his fault would that he could risk his own life to spare her and to save the child

briefly and as gently as might be he stated the result of his errand the doctor had refused to come for a good reason he could not ask him again

young evans felt the logic of the situation which carteret had explained sufficiently to the nurse it was even clearer if she or any other woman had been in the doctors place she would have given the same answer

mrs carteret did not stop to reason in such a crisis a mothers heart usurps the place of intellect for her at that moment there were but two facts in all the world her child lay dying there was within the town and within reach a man who could save him with an agonized cry she rushed wildly from the room

carteret sought to follow her but she flew down the long stairs like a wild thing the least misstep might have precipitated her to the bottom but ere carteret with a remonstrance on his lips had scarcely reached the uppermost step she had thrown open the front door and fled precipitately out into the night

millers doorbell rang loudly insistently as though demanding a response absorbed in his own grief into which he had relapsed upon carterets departure the sound was an unwelcome intrusion surely the man could not be coming back if it were some one else â what else might happen to the doomed town concerned him not his child was dead â his distracted wife could not be left alone

the doorbell rang â clamorously â appealingly through the long hall and the closed door of the room where he sat he could hear some one knocking and a faint voice calling

 open for gods sake open  

it was a womans voice â the voice of a woman in distress slowly miller rose and went to the door which he opened mechanically

a lady stood there so near the image of his own wife whom he had just left that for a moment he was wellnigh startled a little older perhaps a little fairer of complexion but with the same form the same features marked by the same wild grief she wore a loose wrapper which clothed her like the drapery of a statue her long dark hair the counterpart of his wifes had fallen down and hung disheveled about her shoulders there was blood upon her knuckles where she had beaten with them upon the door

 dr miller she panted breathless from her flight and laying her hand upon his arm appealingly â when he shrank from the contact she still held it there â  dr miller you will come and save my child  you know what it is to lose a child  i am so sorry about your little boy  you will come to mine  

 your sorrow comes too late madam he said harshly  my child is dead i charged your husband with his murder and he could not deny it why should i save your husbands child  

 ah dr miller  she cried with his wifes voice â she never knew how much in that dark hour she owed to that resemblance â  it is my child and i have never injured you it is my child dr miller my only child i brought it into the world at the risk of my own life  i have nursed it i have watched over it i have prayed for it â and it now lies dying  oh dr miller dear dr miller if you have a heart come and save my child  

 madam he answered more gently moved in spite of himself  my heart is broken my people lie dead upon the streets at the hands of yours the work of my life is in ashes â and yonder stretched out in death lies my own child  god woman you ask too much of human nature  love duty sorrow justice call me here i cannot go  

she rose to her full height  then you are a murderer she cried wildly  his blood be on your head and a mothers curse beside  

the next moment with a sudden revulsion of feeling she had thrown herself at his feet â at the feet of a negro this proud white woman â and was clasping his knees wildly

 o god  she prayed in tones which quivered with anguish  pardon my husbands sins and my own and move this mans hard heart by the blood of thy son who died to save us all 

it was the last appeal of poor humanity when the pride of intellect and caste is broken  when we grovel in the dust of humiliation when sickness and sorrow come and the shadow of death falls upon us and there is no hope elsewhere â we turn to god who sometimes swallows the insult and answers the appeal

miller raised the lady to her feet he had been deeply moved âbut he had been more deeply injured this was his wifes sister â ah yes  but a sister who had scorned and slighted and ignored the existence of his wife for all her life only miller of all the world could have guessed what this had meant to janet and he had merely divined it through the clairvoyant sympathy of love this woman could have no claim upon him because of this unacknowledged relationship yet after all she was his wifes sister his childs kinswoman she was a fellow creature too and in distress

 rise madam he said with a sudden inspiration lifting her gently  i will listen to you on one condition my child lies dead in the adjoining room his mother by his side go in there and make your request of her i will abide by her decision

the two women stood confronting each other across the body of the dead child mute witness of this first meeting between two children of the same father standing thus face to face each under the stress of the deepest emotions the resemblance between them was even more striking than it had seemed to miller when he had admitted mrs carteret to the house but death the great leveler striking upon the one hand and threatening upon the other had wrought a marvelous transformation in the bearing of the two women the sadeyed janet towered erect with menacing aspect like an avenging goddess the other whose pride had been her life stood in the attitude of a trembling suppliant

 you have come here cried janet pointing with a tragic gesture to the dead child â  you to gloat over your husbands work all my life you have hated and scorned and despised me your presence here insults me and my dead what are you doing here  

 mrs miller returned mrs carteret tremulously dazed for a moment by this outburst and clasping her hands with an imploring gesture  my child my only child is dying and your husband alone can save his life ah let me have my child she moaned heartrendingly  it is my only one â my sweet child â my ewe lamb 

this was my only child replied the other mother   and yours is no better to die than mine 

 you are young said mrs carteret  and may yet have many children â this is my only hope if you have a human heart tell your husband to come with me he leaves it to you he will do as you command

ah cried janet i have a human heart and therefore i will not let him go my child is dead â o god my child my child  

she threw herself down by the bedside sobbing hysterically the other woman knelt beside her and put her arm about her neck for a moment janet absorbed in her grief did not repulse her

listen pleaded mrs carteret you will not let my baby die you are my sister âthe child is your own near kin  

 my child was nearer returned janet rising again to her feet and shaking off the other womans arm  he was my son and i have seen him die i have been your sister for twentyfive years and you have only now for the first time called me so  

listen â sister returned mrs carteret was there no way to move this woman  her child lay dying if he were not dead already she would tell everything and leave the rest to god if it would save her child she would shrink at no sacrifice whether the truth would still further incense janet or move her to mercy she could not tell she would leave the issue to god

 listen sister  she said  i have a confession to make you are my lawful sister my father was married to your mother you are entitled to his name and to half his estate

janets eyes flashed with bitter scorn  and you have robbed me all these years and now tell me that as a reason why i should forgive the murder of my child  

 no no  cried the other wildly fearing the worst  i have known of it only a few weeks â since my aunt pollys death i had not meant to rob you â i had meant to make restitution sister for our fathers sake who did you no wrong give me my childs life 

janets eyes slowly filled with tears â bitter tears â burning tears for a moment even her grief at her childs loss dropped to second place in her thoughts this then was the recognition for which all her life

she had longed in secret it had come after many days and in larger measure than she had dreamed  but it had come not with frank kindliness and sisterly love but in a storm of blood and tears not freely given from an open heart but extorted from a reluctant conscience by the agony of a mothers fears janet had obtained her hearts desire and now that it was at her lips found it but apples of sodom filled with dust and ashes

 listen   she cried dashing her tears aside  i have but one word for you âone last word âand then i hope never to see your face again  my mother died of want and i was brought up by the hand of charity now when i have married a man who can supply my needs you offer me back the money which you and your friends have robbed me of you imagined that the shame of being a negro swallowed up every other ignominy â and in your eyes i am a negro though i am your sister and you are white and people have taken me for you on the streets â and you therefore left me nameless all my life  now when an honest man has given me a name of which i can be proud you offer me the one of which you robbed me and of which i can make no use for twentyfive years i poor despicable fool would have kissed your feet for a word a nod a smile now when this tardy recognition comes for which i have waited so long it is tainted with fraud and crime and blood and i must pay for it with my childs life  

 and i must forfeit that of mine it seems for withholding it so long sobbed the other as tottering she turned to go it is but just

 stay â do not go yet  commanded janet imperiously her pride still keeping back her tears  i have not done i throw you back your fathers name your fathers wealth your sisterly recognition i want none of them â they are bought too dear  ah god they are bought too dear  but that you may know that a woman may be foully wronged and yet may have a heart to feel even for one who has injured her you may have your childs life if my husband can save it will she said throwing open the door into the next room  go with her  

 god will bless you for a noble woman   exclaimed mrs carteret  you do not mean all the cruel things you have said â ah no i will see you again and make you take them back i cannot thank you now  oh doctor let us go  i pray god we may not be too late 

together they went out into the night mrs carteret tottered under the stress of her emotions and would have fallen had not miller caught and sustained her with his arm until they reached the house where he turned over her fainting form to carteret at the door

 is the child still alive   asked miller

 yes thank god answered the father  but nearly gone

 come on up dr miller called evans from the head of the stairs  theres time enough but none to spare
