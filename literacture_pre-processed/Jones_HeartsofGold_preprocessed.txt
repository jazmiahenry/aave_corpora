hearts of gold jones j mchenry  novel
we cannot stem the tide the cumulative force of discouraging circumstances stands as a bar sinister to every new fledged hope i wish i had your sanguine disposition lotus but five years of buffeting with the white caps of real life destroy many of the seasand castles of our old high school days said clement st john

i am five years older as well as yourself you must remember but my faith in the fickle future of which you speak so disparagingly is as bright as it was when with our diplomas we marched home from commencement replied the young man addressed as lotus

your life has been so different from mine clement continued you have not been ground between the upper and nether stone of mens constant faults and occasional virtues you have lived so long in washington oscillating between the pension office and the medical school that you imagine the whole world to be peacefully swinging within your arc

i hope i am not quite so circumscribed said lotus laughing you newsgatherers are too apt to conclude from a pessimistic contact with the dark side of life that those who do not readily accept your views are rainbow chasers

no no you judge me too harshly the shell has not quite grown over me i am still able to award credit where it is due contemplating myself from your standpoint i feel like an antiquated mote between two hills with only a patch of blue sky to canopy my narrow world while i am free to admit i can not see a heaven as resplendent as your telescope compasses still a few brilliant twinklers linger to give the hoped for better day at least a melancholy welcome replied clement earnestly

give me your hand comrade of my youth you begin to talk like my st clement of old we were to be knights in the real work of life do you remember asked lotus feelingly

clement st john and lotus stone for this was the name of the other disputant had not met for nearly two years as intimate as brothers for the most of their lives they had lived next door neighbors from boyhood in the city of minton graduating in the same class clement st john had drifted into the newspaper office his friend into a departmental clerkship in washington the two young men were remarkably unlike in appearance disposition and character afroamericans both they were as dissimilar as the polish jew and his brother of the same lineage in the streets of cairo

in complexion clement st john was fair in truth too fair for an afroamerican or any other american to the manor born his skin save here and there marked by an ugly freckle was as free from pigment as an albinos his white face with undoubted african features was crowned with a shock of reddishbrown hair stiff and bristly a sickly mustache of faded red which the wearer fearing it would lose its curl twisted nervously gave to his angular features a decidedly unique expression from beneath a scanty row of disarranged eyebrows peeped a steel gray eye which under certain surroundings shaded into a faded blue his eyes possessed a daring twinkle at utter variance with the insipid color of his face large hands which in reality were not mates tall narrowshouldered and awkward clement st john was a young man with a clear head stout heart and upright disposition

lotus stone had that peculiar complexion seen in no land but our own and among no other people but afroamericans his complexion was a transparent brown without the swarthiness which is noticeable in the other dark races of the world

his color was the product of a century of miscegenation of the best blood of the caucasian negro and indian races his features were regular black eyes black mustache heavy eyebrows within a line of meeting made a face that one might dwell upon restfully after contemplating for a time upon the singular looks of his companion

his hair which was closely cut had a wiry tendency which proved that through a century of infiltration the negro was still on top he wore a pair of goldrimmed glasses made secure by a black silk cord the latter appendage was indeed necessary as the glasses for want of sufficient bridge sat awkwardly upon the saddle which nature had designed for spectacles or a different make he was dressed in the fatigue uniform of the knights of the red cross

the two friends after the greetings common to men who are renewing old and agreeable acquaintance dropped into the subject always nearest the intelligent afroamerican heart the race outlook

after the conversation the conclusion of which is given the two friends sat for some time looking into the restless water frisking in joyous buoyancy in that august sunshine each occupied with his own thoughts gazed out upon the lake where outlined in the dim distance against the clear blue sky two tireless lake steamers oscillated with arithmetic precision

what a perfect day said lotus breaking the silence just breeze enough to ruffle the lake and break the monotony that contemplation of endless wave and sky produces

i have been watching those whalebacked lake boats with the black smoke streaming far out behind they move like indians single file how patiently they seem to bear their burden from far off superior clement replied

they move as stately as if conscious of good work almost completed see continued lotus the flock of longwinged lake birds circling around the main mast darting now and then toward the water laving their breasts anew in natures baptismal fount

a picture from which we must take fresh courage my friend said clement placing his big awkward hand upon the shoulder of his companion

our hilarious friends are not worrying over the outlook for the race said lotus looking toward the quay where a noisy multitude of laughing afroamericans awaited the arrival of the carrier pigeon on this boat they were to complete their journey

lotus stone and clement st john were part of that large number of afroamericans who engaged in a temporary exodus by way of the lakes to attend the reunion of knights templars at mt clare during the summer of â what a crowd of them hurrying to mt clare many of them hope to set foot for the first time upon the region of the queen where else on earth could be found so large a number of people so unlike in appearance yet each claiming blood relation with the other every kind and condition of the better class of afroamericans were here represented what a strange variety of human beings what a panorama of the races of the world in color every nationality from northern europe shading down through france italy portugal across the mediterranean into egypt morroco and then to equatorial africa perhaps not a man woman nor child of all these strangely dissimilar types would have hesitated a moment to answer to the name of negro old men and women who had come north in the days immediately preceding and after the war with their grown sons and daughters stop the pendulum of their busy lives and take advantage of the opportunity to sail across the lakes

the picturesque knights in their jaunty fatigue uniforms lend martial splendor to the occasion here the beau and belle with many an honest glance pass and repass each other as they gaily promenade up and down the quay a notable feature of the assembly is the universal cheerfulness that characterizes it a like number of no other race in our country their equals financially could approach these afroamericans in gallantry and orderly demeanor

many of them are from the far south and for the first time taste the only hospitality that the north gives or the afroamerican wants pay for what you get and get what you pay for many of them for the first time sit unmolested in a restaurant or hotel

fine fellows these who would pass for men in any country in the world with possibly one exception here are men from almost every state in the union men who have held high places among their fellows and filled those places with marked distinction

the shrill scream of the carrier pigeon warns the happy excursionists that they must prepare to resume their journey after much ado the last of the crowd get aboard and the boat turns her bow away from land and the familiar hills of the best loved state fade from sight clement and lotus seated well toward the front observed the crowd with growing interest the merry laugh of happy contentment rang out over the lake

the brass bands good bad and indifferent mostly indifferent succeeded each other with tireless regularity for the first few hours but as the boat got further away from the shore and the waves increased in size it was noticeable that the music grew more subdued or rather more religious in character as darkne ss came on the wind raised and shifted the lake became boisterous the good ship lurched and trembled at every revolution of her wheels

the moonas it now and then swept into view revealed an angry threatening storm supper was eaten in silence each mouthful of sweetmeats was taken with a furtive glance at the clouds now and then beneath the hush which followed the roll of the steamer a popping cork recorded the fact that some one of the fearful many was determined in one way or another to keep up his spirits

the storm spent its force in threatening the moon again silvered the tossing waters and the cheerfulness increased as the roll of the waves subsided

so the night passed until just as day crept slowly up from the surrounding hills the lights and steeples of mt clare the beautiful came into view

mt clare was literally alive with visiting knights and their friends each new arrival was met at the depot with a band of music the committee of reception and an escort of their fraters music filled the air the streets were lined with people decked in holiday attire the citizens white and black vied with each other in openhanded hospitality

the little city had donned its national dress for the ocasion streamers of red white and blue accompanied by flags of welcome duly bespeaking the insignia of knighthood everywhere flaunted to the breezes the good will which the people bore toward their sable guests every precaution necessary to the comfort and pleasure of the visitor was duly provided by the committee of arrangements the hotel proprietors met the incoming guests with a reassuring smile the white elephant was the headquarters of the grand commandery the knights and their friends like a victorious army of invasion took complete possession of the place

conversing in groups in the office filling every corridor and promenading along every balcony quiet genteel and unobtrusive the visitors in sober earnest held sway

fraternity hall the most commodious audience room in the city was gratuitously tendered as a rendezvous for the commanderies here on the first day of the conclave the mayor of the city spoke his words of welcome and the eminent grand commander delivered his opening address to these ceremonies the great majority paid but little attention sightseeing boatriding and crossing the narrow way that connected the two inland seas and separted our country from the dominion of the english possessed for them a greater fascination canada to the average afroamerican is a land of neverending interest the english ensign to these knights is only one degree less sacred than the flag of the stars and bars

the supreme interest of the conclave week revolved about the second days proceeedingsâthe street parade and the prize drill long ere the morning cock called the earliest risers from their nights repose the hotels were alive with bustle and excitement each company that had entered the list of prize contestants spent two hours before breakfast on the morning of the parade busily executing the prospective programme

each commanders face wore an air of triumph as his men filed in to partake of their wellearned repast

during breakfast the sound of martial music seemed to echo from every point of the compass long before the last knight had folded his napkin and drawn his knees from beneath the table the clattering hoofs of the all important martial of the days horse were heard frantically galloping through the streets of all the officials that form a part of these gatherings the marshal of the day is generally the most excited and useless ornament armed with a little brief authority this self inflated personage with the airs of a major domo and the gilded trappings of a field marshal on muster day delights to see his manly shadow in the sun ordinarily he is a useless appendage but on this occasion he exceeds in supercilious stupidity the arrogance of his kind galloping his foamflecked jade from right to left of the rapidly forming line he gave his orders in a stentorian voice always careful to halt where he could be most advantageously observed by the admiring multitude

glancing from side to side as he passed he searched furtively the faces of the bystanders for a smile of approval which might be appropriated as complimentary to the wisdom of the committee in appointing a man so eminently fitted by nature to fill with grace a position demanding such rare and versatile accomplishments

after three or four excursions from the head to the foot of the line it dawned upon the marshal of the day that the procession waited only his orders to move putting spurs to his horse he once more made his way to the public square where after gallantly saluting the ladies standing upon the steps of the city building he waved his hand to the cannoneer to fire the signal to start the sight was imposing a cordon of mounted police led the parade the grand officers contrary to their general custom followed on horseback the citys protectors not less than three thousand knights each commandery headed by a band marched to the inspiring music with miltary precision chapeaus enriched with ostrich feathers black coats silver trimmings gay uniforms and swords glistening in the sunlight made a spectacle that must be seen to be appreciated along the entire march the citizens lined the streets and openly demonstrated their delight as the intricate movements of the drill were executed proud of the approval of the beholders these black knights lost no opportunity to show themselves worthy of the kindly consideration being accorded them

lotus stone although grand generallissimo of the grand commandery marched as eminent commander of the knights of the red cross whether riding or walking he was the most knightly of all that knightly throng five feet and ten his military bearing and symmetrical form made him easily six feet to the admiring crowd that jostled each other on the curb stones along the line of march

clement st john who would have made any sacrifice for his friend blushed at the momentary thrill of jealousy which he experienced as lotus stone in the front of the red cross commandery passed his point of observation at the outskirts of the city the line halted to take the street cars for recreation park where the outing and prize drill were to be held here the street became a road shaded on one side for some distance by giant elms on the left hand side of the road surrounded by trees stood the home of the late judge underwood

mrs underwood anticipating that the marchers would be thirsty from their long dusty tramp had placed a barrel of cool water in the front yard and standing at the gate as the knights halted under the inviting shade asked them to walk in and slake their thirst the men did not wait to be asked a second time filing through the open gate each gracefully lifting his chapeau to the kind old lady as he passed they soon filled the inclosure clement and lotus were the last to enter

see what the tardy bird always finds said lotus with unmistakable disappointment as he tilted the barrel only to learn that the last clear cupful had been dipped by the man who preceded him

your bread shall be given remarked clement slowly has the water failed

there comes our car we might as well catch it replied lotus as he turned to retrace his steps

wait ill bring you a drink said a girlish voice from the porch

lotus turned just in time to see a sylphlike form disappear through the open door

shall we wait asked lotus our car is moving

there are other cars my unsophisticated friend and if that were the last we had better walk out to the park than miss the sight of such disinterested loveliness said clement with a knowing wink

i am not so sure about the loveliness but there is little doubt of the disinterestedness said lotus with a smile

he had hardly finished the sentence before there appeared at the door pitcher in one hand and glass in the other a vision of beauty that caused both of the young men to forget the moving car and the hilarious knights waving their gauntleted hands from the steps and windows at their friends left behind

clement and lotus rushed simultaneously up the steps to relieve the blushing girl of her burden clement reached the place where she stood first

allow me to relieve you he said bowing and ordering out his holiday smile i am sorry he continued putting forth his hand to take the pitcher that our negligence has caused you so much trouble

she drew back and smilingly poured out a glass of water and as she presented it to the overgallant young man said let me serve you sir knights today your bread shall be given and your water shall be sure she continued archly finishing the quotation which clement had doubtingly made a short time before

clement received the glass and with a deferential bow passed it to his friend your kindness will not be forgotten said lotus returning the glass a glass of water generously given has promise of reward in the annals of the good book

do not mention such a trifle answered the sweet girl

thoughtful trifles for others are the golden lines in the chapter of life said lotus politely as he lifted his chapeau and walked toward the gate as he closed the gate he glanced back at clement st john lingering on the steps in futile dalliance and he too had his instantaneous fit of greeneyed insanity

a sweeter draught from a fairer hand was never quaffed he repeated as he awaited the arrival of an approaching horse car

regenia underwood for this was the young girls name was the very embodiment of vivacious budding womanhood

dressed in some kind of soft white goods draped loosely and clasped at the waist with a rosette of cream ribbon she made a picture seldom seen among the women of our country

too fair for a brunette she was a shade too dark for a blonde her complexion was a cream into which some fairys hand had deftly mixed the first rays of the mornings sun throwing into her color a soft rich radiance indescribably elusive of medium height her form was the perfection of symmetry her face of classic mold was almost severe in its hauteur yet about the well curved red lips and large brown eyes swimming in their liquid depths played constantly the faint suspicion of a smile a wealth of dark brown hair hung in natural ringlets above her oval forehead in the company of such a girl a plain man like clement st john might be excused if he tarried on the steps manufacturing topics of conversation in order to prolong the interview when after an awkward pause he detected regenia peering at the car on the steps of which stood his friend he hastily bade the ladies good day and ran to catch the car for recreation park

well well did you ever see anything like that he asked as soon as he could get his breath

you made a good run for an amateur but i have seen sprinters in my time that could outwind you answered lotus ignoring clements meaning

run out wind who what are you talking about anyway who said i wanted to be entered as a sprinter what are you trying to give me these questions were fired at lotus in a breath you can be obtuse when you are so disposed he continued are you stone in reality as well as in name does a few years in washington effect a man that way

hold hold cried lotus you are drowning me in a sea of interrogations

can you put your hand in the bosom of your waistcoat and say honor bright that you have not seen something unusual in the last half hour if you can i am dummed  he concluded

what are you driving at any way said lotus laughing

do you mean it asked clement excitedly if you do i have nothing more to say

well i do not mean it replied lotus

you are talking nowâlike a man that has been dismissed from the asylum say did you ever see anything half so beautiful

why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing

beautiful she certainly is but from such beauty you and i are forever disqualified he sneeringly replied

i am not half so hopeless as i was a few days since remarked clement there is compensation for all of us while the race has such women as that one why one look into her eyes would banish the blues for a century

the more you talk the more i am mystified

what possible consolation to me did those eyes you are raving over contain

i cant say what influence they exercised over you replied clement indifferently but the lord knows his own and so does your unworthy servant that girl belongs to the unnamed race or i never wrote an editorial

what new wild goose chase are you on now it is preposterous she has not a grain of african pigment beneath her pretty cuticle

call it a wild goose chase if the phrase suits your caprice but mind if you are not on the same chase before another day i may be a narrow selfopinionated newsgatherer but i find out thingsâi do not mope and sigh and run after the impossible i did not serve my apprenticeship on the times without learning a thing or two said clement proudly

recreation park called the conductor the two friends left the car and rapidly bent their steps toward the main pavilion lotus was silent and thoughtful clement st john with one hand on his friends shoulder and gesturing wildly often awkwardly with the other talked incessantly until they passed into the crowd and were lost from view

everything was bustle and excitement as lotus and clement entered recreation park covered with dust and reeking with perspiration the knights look anything but the gay gallants that rendezvoused at the city building a few hours before hunger and fatigue had robbed them of their soldierly bearing but not even these could sully their good spirits the afroamerican is proverbially cheerful he banishes sorrow as an evanescent dream lotus stone had been taking an introspective inventory as helistened to the laudatory exuberance of his friend he paid but little heed to the impression that clement declared the nymph of the elms had made upon himself he knew that clements intoxication would subside as rapidly as it had arisen lotus stone saw in regenia underwood a possible futureâa future in which he might play an important part a consummate dilettante in the social world of washington he had made no embarrassing advancements after floating for three years upon the vortex of that enticing whirlpool society he was as free heart and hand as when he entered its enchanting delirium it was therefore with no longing for another dangling triumph that as he listened to clements somewhat extravagant praise he resolved to know more of the pretty occupant of the elms

clement st john on the contrary was interested in regenia as a new typeâsomebody to talk about and rave over his loquacity at all times was unbounded he thought he often said by talking he called this proceeding thinking audibly it was after his usual manner he went into verbal hysterics concerning the adventure related in the previous chapter as they approached the grand pavilion at the top of the incline an officer who hurried them off to dinner said not a moment to lose grand review at  oclock sharp

i will be on time said lotus seating himself in the nearest vacant chair while lotus and clement are enjoying themselves at dinner let us take a look at recreation park a recent addition to the pleasure resorts of mt clare

for years these grounds were the private belongings of mr g n tolbert an afroamerican and but lately had fallen into the hands of their present owners located about two miles from the city the rapid growth of population in that direction induced the street railway company to make the park the terminus of their road they tried for years to purchase the grounds but the owner being a man of pronounced religious sentiments refused to sell fearing that the place would be converted into a beergarden under a special stipulation that no intoxicating liquors should ever be sold in the park he was finally induced to part with his interest tolbert park was from that time known as recreation park the corporation as far as it could be done without destroying the natural beauties had modernized the place there was a shallow ravine between the entrance and the main part of the park on each side of the carriage way which was elevated so as to make the drive from the gates to the foot of the hill almost level the ravine had been converted into artificial lakes covering the water almost completely broad greenleafed water lilies grew in picturesque profusion the drive up the hill called lovers lane was canopied by the overhanging branches of the deeprooted elms mr tolbert was a tree fancier and every tree that could be induced to sprout in the region of mt clare he planted in his park the great oaks which were by all odds in the majority lifted their proud heads like giant sentinels above their neighbors of a less hardy growth on the east side of the park the hill sloped gently toward the lake at the foot of this incline the street railway company had fitted up a base ball park this was to be the scene of the prize drill scattered about the grounds were rustic seats sylvan bowers and every other device to charm and hold the pleasure seeker

promptly at  oclock the staccato notes of the bugle sounded warning the commanders to get their men in line for the grand review at the second call of the bugle the grand officers took their places on a platform erected for the purpose in the centre of the park to the thrill of inspiring music each company swords at a present passed in review and formed in a double line facing the grand officers the line having been formed the grand generalissimo advanced to the front of the platform and in clear ringing tones heard by every knight in line commands attention sir knights then follows the sword manual apparently satisfied with the proficiency which the knights have exhibited he faces about and reports to the eminent grand commander the announcement is made that the prize contest will take place immediately at the ball park on the east side of the grounds the contestants march to the place appointed the others break ranks and hurry away to secure a comfortable point to observe the drill the grand review being an event of the past lotus immediately instituted a vain search for clement disappointed at not finding his friend he threw himself upon the green sward in the midst of a number of knights to watch the corps manoeuvre

the grounds were so spacious that no one was jostled for want of room the day was perfect seated upon the grass or reclining on one elbow the crowd chatted merrily while the crack commandery heralded by the famous big six band marched upon the field a ripple of applause swelling into a gushing outburst greeted them as with unity of step and elbow to elbow they presented swords to the judges as each new picturesque evolution dissolved into another equally new and decidedly more intricate the enthusiasm of the spectators was unbounded in advance of the judges the delighted observers pronounced the movements perfect amid clapping of hands waving of handkerchiefs and ringing cheers the first contestants marched from the field one fact however was apparent to the initiatedâ much of the enthusiasm was started by a knight in fatigue uniform who surrounded by a half dozen others reclined beneath the banner of the commandery first upon the field lotus tired of reclining thought he wpuld stand up and rest himself by a change of position he noticed as he glanced toward the right a gentleman frantically waving his hat he looked again but as the waving had ceased he gave the incident no further attention but turned to observe the second company which with great eclat was marching upon the field a slight tap on the shoulder and the familiar well old man from clement standing behind him left no doubt of whose hat he saw so imperatively waving but a short time since

i have been wearing my good right arm to a withered shadow of its former size trying to attract your attention said clement

i saw you said lotus apologetically but in such a multitude how could you expect a nearsighted man to determine whether the hat waved for him or someone else

silence said clement in a mock commanding tone follow your leader and ask no questions

lotus obeyed orders they had not gone far before they came to a number of ladies and gentlemen seated upon the grass among whom were regenia underwood lucile malone and mrs levitt the latter was regenias foster mother with little ceremony clement introduced his friend to the ladies

i believe you have met my friend mr stone miss underwood remarked clement as he presented lotus

in face and form he is familiar but this is my first acquaintance with his name said regenia pleasantly

you were determined that mr st johns implied quotation should be literally fulfilled your offer came at a time most needed i was nearly fanfishing for a drink of water lotus hastened to reply

it was too bad that you should come for water just as the well had run dry answered regenia

not as it ended we have been thanking our good angel ever since that we did wait until the first supply had been exhausted said clement who stood listening to the conversation

clement had lucile malone to thank for his introduction to regenia lucile was a stenographer in the office of the times and through her he had often heard of miss underwood lucile and regenia had been friends for years in company with regenia was her chaperone mrs levitt had attended regenias mother in her last illness and held her hand when she died for more than two years after the death of regenias mother mrs levitt had cared for the child she considered regenia too precious to ever stray very far from her foster mothers sight at eighteen regenia was as much of a child to mrs levitt as she was at two wherever the young girl went mrs levitt was at her side and where mrs levitt was not acceptable regenia was rarely seen

lotus addressed his conversation more to mrs levitt than to the fair girl who sat beside her he talked of the knights their hopes and aims regretting incidentally that he was obliged to see so little of the commandery to which he belonged

this led mrs levitt to inquire why he was so frequently absent from his commandery and lotus to disclose his occupation at washington

to this conversation regenia lent an ear not altogether free from curiosity

is it your intention to make washington your permanent abode she asked unable longer to hide the interest which mr stones pleasing talk had created

no said lotus it has not been absolutely decreed that our party will always remain in power and if i had permanent employment he hastened to add i have determined to lead a life fan removed from the delights of washington

would it be considered inquisitive if i should ask what profession you will follow

why a profession asked lotus with a quizzical smile

i am sure i do not know unless it is that you have a professional air answered regenia

there are professions and professions said clement st john my idea of a professionâ he continued is publishing a triweekly newspaper chimed in lucile let me warn you in time ladies mr st john would write up the undertaker at his own wifes funeral if he thought he could get the article in the columns of a leading daily 

not so fast my fair little friend i am not a benedict and if you do not soon give me a more businesslike answer i shall be obliged to cast my eye in another direction said clement with good natured raillery

you did not tell us what profession you are to follow mr stone said regenia blushing as she pronounces the name of lotus for the first time

sawbones said clement

a rousing cheer from the crowd attracted attention to the drill

i like it immensely said lucile but the more i see of it the more complicated it appears

you would make an excellent judge said clement it is a pity that the sphere of woman is so circumscribed the judges will award the prize to the commandery receiving the most applause a knowledge and correct execution of military tactics have nothing to do with the case

is that the way the victors are chosen asked regenia with much surprise

do not regard all mr st john says to be sober earnest observed lotus

do not take anything he says as sober earnest and you will be nearer the truth said lucile laughingly

well you would make a judge and that at least is spoken in sober earnest i am certainly sober whether i meet the approval of miss malone in other respects or not modesty alone deters me from saying answered clement with a knowing smile at lucile

you do not meet my approval said lucile moving away from mr st john

if you are not fire and tow for a half grown girl i am mistaken continued clement tantalizingly

i am not overgrown she retorted that is some consolation at this witty sally the laugh is at clements expense

looking down at his large knotty hands with a questionable smile he said you are more than half right i could take a slice or two from these hands and then have enough left for every practical purpose if your right hand offend you why cut some of it off as he said this he held up his hands laughing as he put them together to show that one was much larger than the other

a hand to wield the pen or the sword with equal dexterity remarked regenia sympathetically she was unused to clement and luciles badinage

thank you and although i do not appear in the ranks of these play soldiers if miss underwood ever needs the services of a real knight she will find me at this address he said passing her his card with a stage bow

regenia discerning the mischievous twinkle in clements eye accepted the card with the same theatrical dignity with which it was presented little dreaming that the time would come when the playful promise would be redeemed

lucile smiled but in her heart she wondered if regenia knew that clement would be as good as his word if any exigency ever put it to the test

do you mean it asked lotus if you do then i have nothing more to say

clement recognized the words he had used on the way to the park and burst into a hearty laugh the girls exchanged significant glances

mr st john and i have a mutual sorrow the memory of which has led us on a wild goose chase lotus remarked by way of explanation

the game is at bay said clement gleefully

you shall know all about it one of these days

said lotus smiling at the girls evident perplexity it is a secret that like wine will improve with age

tell us before it is old enough to walk said lucile sarcastically when it reaches the talking age it may tell on you

do you girls know that the drill is over asked mrs levitt

no we do not and the gentlemen are no better informed than we are mr st john you should have told us that the end was approaching you know how we hate not to be in at the death

you were talking so entertainingly that after a hasty glance at the field i decided that your conversation was more interesting than the antics of those sunshine soldiers said clement with an apologizing smile at lotus

oh thank you if you really mean it said lucile laughing derisively

half in jest the other half in earnest the jest for you the sincerity for miss underwood clement replied showing his teeth at lucile and bowing as gracefully as he could to regenia

listen said mr st john craning his neck toward the judges who were announcing their decision

you ought to be there taking notes you are a very satisfied newsgatherer i think remarked lucile in a whisper

my paper is a weekly i supposed you knew that replied clement

what has that to do with your neglecting to get all the facts concerning this affair she asked

why write up matter that will be given in detail tomorrow i can get my choice from the dailies when you go into the newspaper business you will learn a thing or two he said taking lucile by the shoulders and turning her around

what is a flambeau drill asked regenia

a flambeau drill is a flambeauâcome out tonight and see the red cross commandery he said

the announcement that the prizes would be awarded the victorious contestants from the balcony of the white elephant immediately after the exhibition drill of the flambeau club occasioned regenias question

lotus and clement escorted the ladies to their carriage as the carriage threaded its way through the crowd along the drive to the exit the two young men walked beside it as a kind of selfappointed body guard as the carriage passed through the gate lotus tipped his chapeau and said your presence at the flambeau drill will add much to its effectiveness i assure you

lucile malone who had arrived a few hours before the parade had accepted regenias invitation to spend the conclave week at the elms

the girls had been fast friends in their school days before lucile had gone to minton to study stenography and typewriting by a streak of good fortune she had obtained a position in the office of the times the very day her course was finished lucile was plain but extremely clever poor but independent she went to minton against the advice of every one of her friends regenia excepted what is the use they had said for a colored girl to study stenography no business man will employ her thousands of white girls just as clever and in many other ways more acceptable fail to get positions it is a wanton waste of time and money they said for lucile to take a course of that kind

to all of these croakers lucile gave but one answer ill be convinced when i fail she did not fail such pluck seldom does

when lucile went to the times office clement st john was one of the local editors on the paper to him she was indebted for many delicate hints which counted in her success against the odds to be surmounted

he considered her his special charge and while lucile was not the kind of girl that needed any special protection it pleased clement to imagine that some one at some time would attempt to impose upon her and in the event of such an occurrence he would take no uncertain hand in her defense

lucilesperception was not long in noting the wellmeant solicitation exhibited by mr st john and although at first she mentally resented it she had not been many weeks in the office of the times before she began to rely upon clements guardianship and secretly take comfort in it he assumed the role of protector because he thought lucile a brave girl trying to make her way against untold difficulties he had seen much of the sin and crime that dogged the steps of innocent womanhood he opined that if these temptations were strong against womanhood in general they were herculean when that womanhood had a dark complexion he believed lucile malone proof against every temptation that might assail her and believing this it would have been dangerous for any man to dally with her womanhood

on her way from the office to her home on dark winter nights clement either escorted her or kept near enough to brain any masher that made himself obnoxious it was this appearance of espionage which lucile at first resented but when she learned that not fear that she would do wrong but fear that she would be wronged prompted his actions the feeling of resentment gave way to one of gratitude gratitude ripened into esteem esteem grew into love

as they drove along regenia remarked mischievously i can understand now why your work is so lovely

lucile coloring slightly asked what has been the means of your very recent discovery

mr st john is a very pleasant office boy said regenia

he is not in our office protested lucile he is awfully selfish do you know that sometimes i dont see that man one day in ten

i suspect the knowledge that he is lingering near at night makes your work so awfully lovely as you always write me added regenia with provoking merriment

well he is kind said lucile earnestly wondering if regenia did know that clement lingered around at first i did not like him his looks are against him you know but he has such a delicate sense of what one needs to know and such a sweet little way of making you believe you do know it when in fact he is telling you all the time thatâ thatâ coloring violently he is real interesting after all she blurted out

regenia had found out more than she suspected lucile had disclosed more than she intended

never mind his looks said mrs levitt filling the awkward pause it is not the looks but the heart that makes the man

my dear wise mamma said regenia  you always say the right thing as far as his looks are concerned i think he is handsome

dont mention it said lucile he is the very paragon of ugliness do not praise mr st john to please me you can hardly say worse things about his looks than he says himself

he dont mean it my dear he is well looking enough and you can depend upon his having sufficient conceit to think so men are seldom wanting in conceit disparaging reference to ones appearance as often arises from selflove as selfabasement said mrs levitt wisely

you are always right dear mrs levitt replied lucile i have frequently suspected when mr st john was descanting about his looks in his heart he believed himself not so bad as he delights to make others think he is

a glance into his secret soul some fine sunday morning when in his best clothing he gives himself the parting touch before his mirror would be the only way to ascertain his real opinion of his looks said mrs levitt with a satisfied smile

regenia put great store in mrs levitts common sense mrs levitt was about as well satisfied that regenia was not far wrong in her opinion of her foster mother as regenia was herself

the carriage stopped at the elms just as the street car on the steps of which clement st john stood smoking passed talk about the angels and you hear the rustle of their wings said lucile if you are looking for mr st john she continued he is standing on the steps

i am not looking for anyone answered regenia blushing as if she had been caught in the unmaidenly act of thinking of lotus stone

he has the advantage of being handsome said lucile as she alighted from the carriage

who are you talking of pray you grow more provoking every hour said regenia with well feigned ignorance

 the pleasure of your company at the flambeau drill will add much to its effectiveness said lucile imitating lotus stone

the girls both laughed and arminarm they tripped gaily up the walk to the house

regenia underwood could scarcely remember when she did not live at the elms she was born in canada around her life hung a mystery as impenetrable as egyptian darkness to the curious but perfectly clear to those who knew the history of judge underwoods family mrs underwood had cared for regenia from childhood little by little as the child was able to understand it mrs underwood had related to regenia the story of her birth the good woman wisely determined to circumvent future heart rendings by leaving no sad revelations certain to creep out when most to be regretted to mar the life and hopes of the sweet girl that day by day more closely entwined around her heart some tilings concerning the childs mother discretion bade her withhold but all that was necessary to acquaint regenia with her lineage and race was duly disclosed

there was a note of sorrow discernible in mrs underwoods voice when speaking of regenia no one who saw the beautiful girl with mrs underwood would have suspected that she was an afroamerican regenia knew it but gave the fact no more thought than any other child does who is aware that it is of german irish or french descent she never understood the soft sad tone which mrs underwood assumed unintentionally perhaps when she spoke of the afroamericans

if regenias associates knew of the romance of her birth they were too well bred to make the fact a cause for insult she grew to womanhood feeling and acting not unlike the other children of her age little dreaming of the sad awakening she was destined some day to experience regenias mother was mrs underwoods only child judge underwood a man of pronounced views on every subject was an ardent disciple of wendell phillips a lover of freedom his home was the centre of the abolitionmovement in his county a man of wealth and influence a hater of every form of oppression the cause of the slave appealed with unusual force to his keen sense of justice his house was a station of the underground railroad a peculiar method of assisting runaway slaves to canada conducted for years by the most courageous and daring lovers of personal liberty that ever graced american soil

one dark rainy night a few years previous to the great political upheaval which swept away slavery and its attendant evils a fugitive slave was spirited into judge underwoods barn the slave slept that night in a cave on the premises the sleuth hounds of oppression being hard on his track the judge was away on his circuit but his wife who though born in the south sympathized with her husbands views of slavery was severely taxed to invent some means of shielding the halfstarved hunted wretch until opportunity occurred to forward him to canada the laws of the land made harboring fugitive slaves a crime that entailed upon those who disregarded them the most severe punishment how to feed this poor slave when every movement about the house was watched became to mrs underwood a question of grave concern to go to the cave or to send anyone there would attract suspicion in that direction all the next day the poor fugitive half wild from hunger and fear awaited the coming of succor before the sun went down mrs underwood had solved the vexatious problem she made two long wide bags filled them with bread and meat and pinning them securely to the dress of ethel her daughter she bade her put on her apron and bonnet and drive home the cows

when you approach the cave said mrs underwood look carefully about you and if no one is near go into the cave unpin the bags and leave them for the poor man who must be almost starved by this time

ethel was an intelligent child and quickly comprehended the nature of her mission fired with sympathy for the poor slave she executed her mothers wish in a remarkably short time in this cave ethel first met regenias father george stewart a mulatto with a shock of black hair and dark brown dreamy eyes was still in his teens the southern manhunters were thrown off the scent and george remained at judge underwoods as a servant

ethel was always fond of the young man but her indulgent parents never suspected that her childish admiration might some day ripen into a liking more serious during each winter george was sent to a seminary near his home and being naturally bright soon became quite well informed with little change in the friendship between the judges protege and his daughter ethel grew into womanhood to george stewarts credit be it said he was not aware that his fondness for the sweet girl whose hand first ministered to his wants in direst need would bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of his kind benefactors

the sentiments which judge underwood and his wife cherished for the final liberation of gods oppressed took deeper root in ethels young heart than either of them supposed with ethel sorrow grew into sympathy sympathy deepened into affection and at eighteen ethel was in love with george stewart mrs underwood first divined the girls feelings toward the recent fugitive and trembling with fear related her suspicions to the judge

with judge underwood to suspect was to act he accordingly hastened to sound his daughter upon the state of her feelings toward his servant she frankly admitted her love for george and entrenching herself behind her fathers oftrepeated arguments of the equality of men the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of all gods children completely silenced him george was questioned but denied entertaining for ethel any feelings other than those of kindness and esteem the judge was thoroughly alarmed

after a family council it was decided to send george on to canada and ethel away to boarding school in this way they hoped to end the unfortunate affair

ethel underwood was a very determined young woman with such a spirit a change of place by no means argues a change of sentiment she did not consider the objections offered by her father of sufficient weight to deter her from consummating the plans that were surging through her overwrought brain concerning the object of her affections she loved george stewart if she believed this before she was sent away she knew it afterward she regarded her fathers determination to separate her from her lover as a species of the same sort of persecution she had heard him so vehemently denounce ethel underwood was not more determined than romantic reared in an atmosphere of high pressure sentimentalism she would have willingly suffered martyrdom for the man she loved she pictured poor george driven out upon the charities of a pitiless world because of his love for her and linking with this the sad nemesis which had pursued him until shelter and sustenance could only be found in the caves of the earth she resolved to follow him and comfort him and make his life happy whatever the cost

poor misguided sentimental young woman she never thought once how unhappy she might render two other lives whose claim upon her love and obedience were more imperative than the much cherished fugitives three weeks after entering the boarding school she left to seek george stewart she found him sick and friendless in a strange land she nursed him back to life and soon afterward they were married

it was a pretty romance this beautiful heiress following the hapless fugitive into exile and giving up home friends and luxury all for love a pretty sentiment indeed but a sad misfortune for the illadvised child of indulgence who acts upon such sentiment

ethels parents were speechless with horror when the news of their daughters eccentricity came to their ears nor was this blow to fall singly upon the heads of these two life long friends of human rights the news of ethels wilful misconduct had hardly been related when they were stricken with another calamity not less appalling judge underwood was arrested for assisting runaway slaves and hurried to prison to await the day of trial it was then that the poor mother doubly bereaved longed for the solace of her child

ethel buried in a little inland town in canada knew nothing of the awful afflictions through which her parents were passing in the meantime the war came on and through that the judge was released from confinement he left immediately for europe and did not return for three or four years

during judge underwoods absence george stewart died in the arms of his devoted wife never more devoted than during his last illness the fugitive slave passed beyond the bay of blood hounds and the fear of the slave catcher a few months after his death regenia came

poor discouraged and alone ethel wrote to her parents but received no answer grieving over her sad fate she grew weaker day by day until broken hearted and forgotten she died

one friend had remained steadfast during all her sorrowsâmrs levitt under her roof the fair bride and hapless husband had eaten their wedding dinner and proud indeed had she been that her hands were permitted to care for the sweet young woman who could give up all for her love after the death of regenias mother mrs levitt took the child to her heart and cared for her as if she had been her own on the return of the judge and his wife from europe they found the letter from their daughter the judge came on and took little regenia to mt clare where they had concluded to settle mrs levitt could not endure to be separated from the child and in a few months followed her to mt clare and took up her abode at the elms about two years previous to the events of this story judge underwood broken in health from the misfortunes through which he had passed suddenly died at the death of mrs underwood regenia will be sole heiress to the underwood estates every day mrs underwood discovered some new resemblance to her mother in regenia she had often intended to tell her of the fortune she would some day inherit but from one cause or another she had neglected to do so

after supper on the evening of the day we last saw regenia and lucile tripping up the walk to the elms they passed an hour sitting on the steps of the piazza recounting interesting experiences

i am sure i never could have held out against the united opposition of all my friends had it not been for you said lucile i believed that i could succeed but what does the opinion of one poor little silly girl amount to against the conjoined disapproval of an entire community she continued

yet the one little girl had her way and demonstrated beyond our most sanguine expectations the wisdom of her conclusions answered regenia lightly

if one and god be a majority then the girl with one faithful sincere friend as i had was the largest number after all said lucile laughing heartily at her own wisdom

did you meet with many discouragements but of course you did although you were too plucky to mention them in your letters said regenia answering her own question

not half as many as i had nerved myself to endure men overlook you perhaps step on you in their haste but once it is decided that you are a fixture they mostly leave you to yourself

a fixture replied regenia pray what is that

i only mean that they understand you have come to stay it is wonderful how opposition ceases when people find out that in spite of them you will hold on your course

and mr st john was he of so much assistance asked regenia innocently

he made many suggestions for which i fear i was not sufficiently thankful at first but later on i learned to be secretly grateful for them his help however was moral rather than physical his presence seems to breathe new life in oneâ that is she said a little confused havent you seen people before now whose very company seemed to drive dull care away

i suppose i have said regenia laughingly but i do not recall any of them just at this moment

now dear please dont said lucile pleadingly you must know what i mean

oh certainly i have an idea but of course there is a meaning that is too deep for sighs that i know nothing about yet but i am beginning to live with the hope that the day will come

if you young ladies are going to see the fireworks you would better be getting ready called mrs levitt as she hurried up stairs to her room shall we go asked regenia

 the pleasure of your company will add to its effectiveness said lucile as she slipped her arm around regenias waist and pulled her through the open door

not only the visitors but apparently the entire population of mt clare had preceded the carriage in which regenia lucile mrs levitt and mrs underwood were seated to the square where the flambeau drill was to be conducted strung to the highest pitch of expectation the nervous crowd with frequent signs of impatience awaited the advent of the flambeau club

two squares from the balcony of the white elephant the carriage was obliged to stop the people a solid mass of perspiring humanity filled the street from curb to curb

we shall never be able to see anything in this out of the way place said lucile with evident disappointment

it would not be advisable to drive nearer answered mrs underwood

no indeed even the horses do not take kindly to the common herd said regenia calling attention to the restlessness of the handsome span of black thoroughbreds whose movements required the drivers constant attention

as democratic as i am said mrs underwood smiling faintly i am obliged to confess that i share their dislike

i like a crowd well enough ordinarily but we did not come to see the crowd a flambeau drill can not be seen for the asking i shall die of disappointment if i miss seeing it said lucille her excitement increasing as she contemplated the bare possibility of such a probability

your chances for living hang on a hair if missing this drill will bring your existence to a period said regenia smiling at luciles extravagance

the people ought to be kept back look they have blockaded the streets completely said lucile bristling with anger

i see you have been carried by the excitement into the very heart of the maddened crowd said a pleasant voice beside the carriage

the ladies turned in the direction of the sound to see a physical entity of the vocal exponent in the person of clement st john standing hat in hand bowing and smiling

we are here tis true but from the outlook we shall have only our experience for our pains said lucile after the other occupants of the vehicle had exchanged greetings with mr st john

the prospect is not the most inviting said clement looking around to discover some means of exit if you will allow me i think i can find a more suitable point of observation for you he continued

we do not wish to discommode you mr st john replied regenia

discommode me indeed thought clement he said i am only too happy to make myself useful i assure you

well go and be glad to seize the opportunity said lucile speaking the mind of the entire party how shall we ever extricate ourselves from this knotted skein of human beings she added

i have seats among the press gang on the balcony said clement we can drive around the square to the ladies entrance and in that way avoid the annoyance we should be sure to meet should we attempt to force our way through this tangled skein of human beings  he said smiling at lucile

to this proposition mrs underwood readily consented mounting to a seat beside the driver clement gave mrs underwoods orders to drive to the hotel arriving there they push their way through the crowded halls ascend the stairs and emerge upon the balcony just as the street lights are being lowered to give the torches of the exhibitors the very best effect writing at a long table in the center of the balcony sat a number of local and special correspondents they nodded toward clement as he seated his party and a few who knew him well indicated their pleasure that clements card to the courtesies extended to the press enabled him to serve his friends in such a satisfactory manner

mr st john on the principle before enumerated did not deign to take notes with a knowing smile as he met luciles glance he remarked loud enough to be heard by some of the reporters near him you will perceive ladies that these gentlemen serve me

mr st john regards the seventh commandment very lightly remarked his visavis the ladies laughed

i am sorry to admit that my acquaintance with the commandments numerically is insufficient to grasp without reflection your reference miss malone he replied with a well feigned look of embarrassment

ignorance of the law is no excuse for crime retorted lucile with assumed severity

who speaks of ignorance crime and justice in a breath and emphasizes her pharisaical condemnation with a piercing look in this direction said clement with a burst of merriment

shake not thy bloody locks at me thou art the man replied lucile disdainfully

what crime has my bloody locks ignorantly committed asked clement as he doffed his hat to expose his mop of red hair

plagiarism answered lucile solemnly

plagiarism is good but i always give credit when i steal quotations from the leading journals have more weight than anything i could write over my own signature i write general accounts with the mucilage brush but reserve the right to comment editorially said clement

after this manner the conversation rippled on here and there taking a precipitous flight as it leaped from the sublime to the ridiculous

mrs levitt who had not said one word since the party left the carriage signalized her presence by saying with a sigh well i guess it is coming at last

the others who amid the constant flow of airy talk had almost forgotten the event which was accountable for their presence looked in the direction indicated

away down the avenue marching to a quick step could be seen the approaching torches of the flambeau club the sky was crimson from the reflection of red fire on they come whizzing sky rockets and bursting roman candles forming over their heads an arch of prismatic colors their glittering helmets white uniforms and brass buttons beneath the flare of torch and red fire give to the scene a weird and melancholy beauty the vast army of sightseers herald their approach with one continuous shout of pleasure as they arrive at the hotel they wheel into line and salute the eminent grand commander and ladies upon the balcony the drill was beautiful the combinations were formed more for picturesque display than for military correctness among the many notable effects produced by the flambeau drill the serpentine movements were perhaps the most enjoyed by the observers

to discuss each manoeuvre would be a needless repetition as unprofitable to the reader as unnecessary to the ends of this story at the conclusion of the exhibition mrs underwood unused to the night air expressed her readiness to return to the elms the girls hung back alleging as an excuse for their desire to remain their wish to see the prizes presented to the victors of the afternoon mrs levitt divining the real cause suggested that mrs underwood drive home and leave the girls in care of mr st john mrs underwood agreed to this and in company with mrs levitt left the hotel as she passed through the door opening off the balcony a young man approached her and entered into conversation now clement st john from his position on the balcony had detected that same young man observing him narrowly more than once during the evening

who is he thought clement and why has he stared at me so rudely for the last two hours

as these questions pass through the mind of clement he overhears regenia remark to lucile that is dr frank leighton mrs underwoods nephew

regenia rarely spoke of her grandmother by any term more endearing than mrs underwood she had kept her eyes on lotus stoneduring the entire drill she thought as she sat there watching him for she only had eyes for the column in which he was a conspicuous part he is handsomer tonight than ever once when the company faced the balcony for a moment the electric lights were turned on and lotus instinctively looked up his eyes met regenias for an instant only but in that moment each felt the thrill of mutual admiration

clement said as regenia turned from lotus to him he is remarkably handsome and the very finest gentleman i ever met

regenia blushing hotly made no answer

the presentation speeches were half over when lotus stone with a low bow greeted his friends on the balcony he had hastened to his room as soon as the drill was ended and exchanged his white duck uniform for a suit less conspicuous

accept my congratulations old man your people did themselves proud tonight who would not be a soldier and go on dress parade said clement heartily as lotus came up

the two young ladies offered congratulations when mr st john had finished i think it was awfully lovely mr stone and you were the very best of all said lucile earnestly

hear that ejaculated mr st john  who would not be a soldier and go on dress parade  he began singing in a low key

and did you like it miss underwood asked lotus

although i do not understand your movements i think the flambeau drill the most beautiful sight i ever saw replied regenia

that is something like it said clement mischievously but giving all the praise to one man is too much

lucile does not think more highly of mr stones part in the evenings entertainment than i do answered regenia with an arch look at mr st john

what would i not give to be a member of the flambeau club said clement with mock dejection there is nothing left for the rest of us but to seek the charitable seclusion of the grave unwept unhonored and unsung 

it is not that bad i hope said lotus smiling at the rare good spirits that possessed his friend

the drill was indeed lovely mr st john but we are indebted to your generosity entirely that we were permitted to enjoy such an excellent view of it we shall not forget your kindness if we do praise the knights of the red cross so enthusiastically said regenia in her sweet earnest way

mr st john knows how much we thank him said luile dont mind what he says dear when you know him as well as i do you will read his talk between the lines

the idea of reading audible expressions between the lines to thy finger board miss typewriter the copyist sees everything in violet ink you see between the lines better than you see the lines sometimes i suspect said clement lightly

he is through at last said regenia referring to the speech of presentation just finished

how much of it did you hear asked lotus not a great deal i admit ladies and gentlemen and perhaps i add no more she replied smiling at her questioner

i did not hear that much he said lowering his voice there was other music that i much preferred to hear

i suppose so she answered the notes of praise sounded in your ears have not been confined to this balcony i conjecture

with me said lotus it is not the song but the singer not the high key of mechanical training but the sweet old songs that reach the heart not the applauding multitude but the admiring few

i agree with you she answered dropping her bantering tone it is earnestness in everything that makes anything worth while

suppose we go said lucile rising they will think at home that we are lost regenia

mr st john will be held responsible he seems to be our scape goat answered regenia

yes scape goat pack mule or anything else so i may be permitted to bask in your smiles miss underwood said clement leading the way to the stairs

how do you get along with mr st john asked regenia laughingly as clinging to mr stones arm they pushed their way through the crowded corridor toward the ladies exit

clement is extremely well pleased tonight said lotus

when he is happiest he is most provoking answered her escort we have always known each other he continued and i do not know whether i came to the conclave for anything more serious than to see clement st john

i thought you enjoyed the wild applause of the gaping multitude oh no she made haste to say you did inform me differently

speaking of mr st john he said there is not a more seriously earnest man of my acquaintance notwithstanding his apparent lightness

i should think him anything but serious answered regenia with much surprise

in that respect you agree with everyone who has only seen the crude exterior at heart clement st john is an unusually thoughtful levelheaded man his gaiety is often assumed he makes the sufferings of his race a hobby and takes their aggregated wrongs as so many personal affronts keenly alive to their multifarious grievances with tongue or pen he is ever ready to do battle in behalf of the cause he loves i sometimes think that his opponents are only the conjurations of his overactive imagination said lotus did you ever read his paper

no i have not she answered

i would be pleased to send you a copy if you would like to read it

certainly ifâifâ

if what you seem to hesitate

if you like she added she wondered if on such short acquaintance it would not be bad taste to accept his offer he did not think so or he would not have made such a tender she finally concluded after knowing him a day regenia found herself trusting this stranger in a way that almost frightened her with a shiver she glanced over her shoulder for lucile and mr st john he noticed the tremor in the hand that held his arm and instantly remarked you are not cold miss underwood

no she said i fear i have not been confining my thoughts entirely to the subject of our conversation

as they sauntered home in the moonlight lotus told her of his life in washington how he longed to go out in the world and make a name of his intention to resign as soon as he had finished his medical course

where will you practice she interrupted with more interest than she was aware of

i have not decided but most likely in the south he answered the south offers the most flattering inducements to a young man who has no political aspirations he continued i have had enough of politics he continued more to himself than to his companion

she knew but little of politics and was therefore discreetly silent why he had enough of politics she neither knew nor was she particularly interested

why do you prefer the south with its discriminations and difficulties to the north she finally asked

for many reasons the first of which is there are more of our people in the south than in the north regenia noted his emphasis upon our people the expression was new to her

second the natural antipathy existing between the races in the south makes the professional service rendered to the afroamerican grudgingly indifferent the physician is a missionary his work presupposes a double duty healing the body and comforting the mind

i think that duty can be done in one place as well as another replied regenia holding to her unexpressed wish

perhaps so said lotus but in a city like this say a man could not get the patronage of his own race the north is the best place to prepare for war but an afroamerican must go south to practice it

are you two so interested in each other that you do not know where to stop called lucile

we are at home said regenia blushing by âhat time clement and lucile had reached the gate

shall we see you safe within the door said clement opening the gate

you are responsible answered regenia

how would it do to let mr stone share some of this responsibilty the load is getting too heavy for my shoulders

i am only too willing to share any responsibility that these ladies may see fit to put upon me said lotus gallantly

they may is good but suppose i wish to do some unloading in that case is your gallantry unflinching asked clement

oh certainly said lotus

as they walked up the gravel way clement suggested that they march by fours

how about tomorrow asked clement as the girls bade them goodnight

you arrange with mr stone ill be responsible for regenia lucile replied

if it is a conspiracy said lotus i only hope that in the intrigue you may contrive to capture me

arminarm as in the days of old clement and lotus walked back to the white elephant neither spoke until the elms was left sleeping in the hazy distance clement as usual broke the silence

i might as well confess that i am hit hard that bewitching little woman rivets her chains more securely every time i see her she is all the world to me he began to sing

a charming companion indeed said lotus and best of all she believes in you

as if that was such a devil of a job said clement laughingly

you are rather hard to find lotus replied but that mischievous little woman has found your heart and more than that she believes in you sees between the lines and you know it and she knows you know

you are more right than wrong said clement how about our beauty at the elms 

lotus winced he did not like clements familiar way of speaking about regenia

she is yours lotus if you follow up your impressions he continued misinterpreting his friends silence

she is a noble highsouled womanâsuch a woman as any man might wish to win but wishing and winning are two things replied lotus thoughtfully

what a woman like miss underwood needs is some awful calamity to arouse her dormant affections if she could be led to believe that she was making some great sacrifice for you or you were being hated and maligned for her either would answer she would give up her life for you say i have it suppose you hire some one to slug you gently and do the unconscious act and let me send post haste for miss underwoodâ why old man what is the matter you are not losing your temper

lotus came dangerously near losing it at the nonsensical proposition clement was making

they walked on in silence until the lights of the white elephant loomed up in the next block

excuse me old friend lotus said stopping i believe i am hit harder than i thought

dont mention it havent i received right between the eyes a knockout blow said clement

at this they both laughed and lotus extending his hand said as clement grasped it what fools we mortals be

the last day of the conclave had come it was the intention of the committee to make the festivities of the day equal if they did not surpass the pleasures of the preceding one an excursion up the river to an island located in a not distant lake and the banquet at night were to round out the closing hours of the conclave in a blaze of glory in order to accommodate the large number of excursionists two palatial lake steamers were lashed together the brass band stationed upon an improvised platform built well to the front and between the two boats discoursed sweet music for the occupants of both steamers the removal of a part of the guard rails from the upper and lower decks of the steamers and the substitution of a plank gangways flanked on either side by ropes virtually converted the two boats into one the day was delightful a gentle breeze sweeping down from the lake gave to the occasion an exhilirating zest unfolded the flags which hung from the jackstaffs of the boats and fluttered into uncontrolled gaiety the triclored bunting which everywhere bespoke the patriotism of the promoters the scene at the landing was interesting in the extreme the ticket agents their satchels hung over their shoulders pushed back and forth through the surging mass apparently trying to accommodate everyone who wanted a ticket at the same time

clement and lotus were there in time to see the excited crowd elbowing each other right and left excitingly securing tickets and hurrying aboard the boats

nobody seems to be going said clement

my what a crowd where do the people come from lotus replied

and it was a crowd the fat woman was there boisterous and selfassertive the lean woman was there spiteful and sarcastic the refined woman sad and disgusted and the jolly woman jostled crushed but delighted every size class cast and color of the afroamerican woman was on that quay each knowing her rights and if belligerent looks are any indication ready to maintain them it was virtually a war between women and with tongue and eyes was it bitterly waged nor was this scene void of other amusing incidents more than one old lady with a son or daughter taller than herself labored in vain to jew the perplexed ticket agent from full fare to half that amount so great was the rush that many in hasty disgust despaired of ever being able to get a ticket and accordingly returned to their lodging places these last were principally married women whose husbands slothfulness had rendered the pleasures of the trip stale flat and unprofitable when compared with the future prospect of reminding these poor men of the disappointment their execrable conduct had occasioned some of the gay gallants halted between two opinions undecided whether to go on the excursion or attend the banquet many could not attend both for financial reasons it had begun to dawn slowly upon many of the young men and a few of the old who had been living like princes for the past three days that an awful financial catastrophe was staring them in the face others as they hesitated wondered who in all that knightly band would lend them the price of admittance to the banquet provided they hazarded their last available penny on a trip up the river among the last to come aboard the boats were regenia and lucile in fact the last warning tap of the bell had sounded before they pushed through the crowd and ascended the stairs mrs levitt and mrs underwood waved a fond adieu as the two steamers backed away from the landing and slowly swung out into the river dr frank leighton a victim of curiosity sat on the upper deck dreamily smoking a cigar

it was a mixed multitude a vast number of citizens piqued by curiosity or from motives more friendly grouped in little knots seemed to be enjoying the prospect of a pleasant trip quite as much as the afroamericans the boats were fairly under way before clement and lotus were able to get in anything like speaking distance of lucile and regenia the girls were comfortably seated in the after recess of the cabin the young men had tried in vain to catch the eyes of the girls as they swerved back and forth through the talking gesturing throng

at last said clement as he and lotus approached the girls do you know we have been trying every second of the last half hour to reach this promised land surrounded on all sides by water

where have you been asked lucile with her usual impetuosity we thought you were left we have been trying to find you i believe i just informed you answered clement smiling we have been in sight of the delectable spot for some time but how to reach it without climbing over the head of some one who is here on equal terms with ourselves has kept us impatiently waiting until this blessed moment

and mr stone said lucile who had been addressing clement are you in good spirits after the severe test of yesterday

a little the worse for so much marching said lotus but an excess of that sort of thing is so infrequent that the change is as beneficial as discipline

i prefer my discipline in broken doses said clement

mr st john has a predilection for homeopathic treatment in this particular said regenia

i am regular replied lotus divining regenias implied question

oh thats your school is it i am gaining information for which i did not ask she replied naively

the young men dressed a la negligee leaning against the guard rail the girls in their jaunty outing suits made a picture that few of the moving mass passed without a second look

regenia introduced the young men to dr leighton who after a few haughty words went back to his chair a little distance away whence he watched the group with eyes of jealousy if not hatred dr frank leightons feeling toward regenia alternated between desperate love and blind hatred sometimes he has wished her out of his life and would have gladly stood by her open grave and dropped on her lowering bier a tear of mingled joy and regret regenia alone stood between dr leighton and the underwood estates cherishing such feelings toward regenia he was possessed with a spasm of hate as he saw her actually enjoying the company of lotus and clement when in regenias presence her gentle manner and sweet face almost persuaded dr leighton to marry her and end his agony but when he thought of his social position and the pride of his relations he abandoned the idea and heartily wished her dead today as he sat there observing every move and mood of regenia he was a prey to the tortures of conflicting emotions while the party in which we are most interested are conversing as light hearted highspirited young people will do they have not noticed that the chairs are being moved back and one or two sets are preparing to engage in dancing clement st john and lucile after looking on for awhile joined in the merriment

as i shall be too busy to dance tonight we will indulge today he remarked to lucile

she readily consented and they were soon whirling in the dizzy waltz the gayest of the gay

regenia declined to accept mr stones invitation to participate i rarely dance she said and when i do it is not in public

lotus was an inveterate lover of dancing and when after a half hour of looking on clement insisted that he and regenia should make the final couple in a set of the landers he persuaded regenia to forego her scruples and yield to the wishes of her friends regenia enjoyed the sparkling conversation of mr stone much more than she did the dancing she was not quite clear upon the propriety of dancing in public from a moral standpoint she did not object but found herself today as on the evening before wondering if it was good form to pass the time so freely with a man whose acquaintance she had so recently made she greeted the last figure of the dance with secret delight

when the girls were again comfortably seated the young men proposed a lemon ice the girls are requested to remain where they are and clement and lotus started edging their ways through the crowd intent upon their errand the refreshments were upon the lower deck of the boat the dancers in their enjoyment had not observed a dark cloud gathering toward the northeast and that since the steamers had struck the open lake they did not move so smoothly the young men noticed as they pushed through the crowd that the loud laugh had sobered somewhat and that here and there groups of wiser heads stood earnestly talking intent upon the business of the moment they pushed on shouldering right and left and then standing still until some one changed position at last they succeeded in making the gangway leading to the other boat here the same process of inching to the stairway stopping and waiting and creeping down had to be repeated

well said clement as he stood mopping his forehead we have at last reached the goal but it seems longer since we started than it took columbus to find a new world

what will you have sharply asked the woman selling ices for their weight in silver

anything so it is cold answered clement good naturedly

how we shall ever carry a lemon ice back through that crowd is what knocks me said lotus turning from the table with the precious aliment in hand

if those young ladies imagined what straits we are being put to in order to cater to their palates they would worship us while they lived and dying remember us in their wills said clement laughingly

the average young lady gives herself but little worry about our sufferings when her pleasure is concerned answered lotus ruefully

as they stood there talking the spray from a wave that dashed against the boat awakened them to a sense of their danger glancing toward the cabin of the opposite boat they beheld a scene of the greatest commotion hastening to the stairway they try in vain to mount to the upper cabin the steamer trembles and lurches and now and then a scream of terror shakes the multitude like an aspen leaf

what is the matter up there cried clement to those above but received no answer

we have struck the lake and are meeting a little heavier seas remarked lotus noting the water dashing against the side of the vessel and breaking over the guards

to stand there unable to lift his hand in luciles behalf fills clement st john with a wild desire to be at her side or die in the attempt again he tries to mount the stairs he throws himself against the wedgedin mass of men and women but his efforts are in vain he might as well kick against the rock of gibraltar so far as any visible impression is made he vented his disappointment upon the inoffensive head of a nervous old man who sat at the foot of the stairs weeping as if his heart would break

lord have mercy on us misterare we all going to be drowned queried the old man in a piteously piping tone as he noticed the water dashing over the guards

thats the way it looks said clement

oh my lord oh my lord cried the old man

if you dont shut up ill pitch you into the lake id put you there anyway he saidhis good nature getting the better of his anger if i did not have so much respect for the fish they would need a dentist down there sure after one or two attacks on your tough hide

oh lord oh lord cried the old man as he dropped a piece of lemon pie which he was eating and with big hot tears chasing each other down his wrinkled cheeks and the remains of the pie clinging to the corners of his mouth he fell on his knees and began to pray lustily

lotus too was baffled and out of humor but he could not suppress the smile which clements droll remark called up

there now he said kindly to the old man you are all right no danger if you just keep quiet

he had hardly ceased speaking to the old man when he heard an officers voice above the roar of the wind and dash of the waves stand back that cable is going to part he could hear the shuffling of feet above and then like the report of a musket the rope holding the boats together in front snapped

he could feel the boats swinging away from each other his heart sank within him as he thought of regenia the tremor of the boats as they swing away from each other and alternately return causes the passengers crowding the stairs to move a little with the agility of a cat lotus springs into the opening and snatching the man above him backward rushes into his place he serves the man above him in the same way and in an incredibly short time has gained the cabin as he reached the cabin to his infinite horror he sees the boats gradually swinging apart he starts for the gangway climbing over those in his way being cursed struck down thrown back only to begin again with redoubled determination as he pushes his way against tremendous odds to the guards he sees the stage planks between the boats inching nearer and nearer toward the edge âhe hears the platform fall and for a moment despairs looking across the abyss what a sight meets his eyes regenia pushed on by the force behind her clings to one of the uprights of the guard on the verge of the opening which made the passage between the boats one of her feet hangs over the side and the treacherous gang plank one end of which has fallen to the deck of the boat on which lotus is standing while the other end is on the upper deck of the other boat within a foot of regenia a motion of the boat will throw that plank forward in falling it will crush the girl break her hold on the upright and the cruel waves or more cruel wheel will hide her sweet face forever all of this passes through lotus stones mind in a moment glancing toward the stern of the boat he saw that the cables were being unloosed this would separate the boats setting his teeth and tightening every muscle in his wiry body and whispering god help me he sprang forward throwing those in his way to the deck and walking over them he mounted the guard rail just as the boats began to separate balancing himself for a moment he sprang across the yawning everwidening chasm and catching the upright to which regenia clung he dropped upon the deck beside her throwing himself between regenia and the slowly approaching stage plank while he held to the upright with one hand it was but the work of a moment to catch the stage plank with the other bending forward with almost superhuman strength he threw the heavy plank into the foaming lake

this done he waved back the crowd and led the exhausted girl beyond the fear of danger for a moment the people on both steamers forgot their fears and sent up a wild cheer that fairly rent the sky the enthusiasm which the heroic deed created drowned for a time the mad plash of the waters and the moan of the threatening wind

as lotus glanced over his shoulder he saw dr frank leighton standing on the opposite side of the open guard rail nonchalantly twisting the ends of his mustacheâa disappointed sneer on his handsome faceâan angry consuming fire burning in his black eyes the eyes of the two men met but for a moment but each read in the soul of the other that hatred which the other felt and gloried in the feeling lotus could not express the contempt he felt for the man who by the slightest effort could have rescued regenia from the fate he must have seen so certainly pending if that deadly stage plank but moved six inches more dr leighton as usual being doubtful whether to be glad or sorry at the rescue of his fair cousin nevertheless hated lotus stone for saving her

as the crowd gave way lotus helped regenia to a chair she had swooned in the act of seating her he unintentionally lowered his left arm allowing her head for a moment to drop toward the floor the movement was fortunate as the blood at the command of gravity rushed back to her brain thus reviving her

when regenia opened her eyes for a moment she was at a loss to know what had happened but seeing lotus it all came back to her oh thank you thank you was all she could say

but that was enough for lotus for such a look as she gave him he would have willingly made a second leap

the boats were separted but not before clement st john had pushed his way to the rear end of the boat and crossing with less danger than lotus had incurred found lucile the boats having separated slowly steamed back to mt clare on the way back regenia had ample time to thank mr stone for his timely help lotus protested that he had done nothing to be thanked for when they were again safe on land clement and lucile joined them

where is dr leighton said regenia he made one of our party and ought to return with us

i do not see him said clement but i dare say he will put in an appearance when he is neither wanted nor expected

why mr st john said lucile you ought not to speak with so much asperity of one you have known so short a time

i only met him today it is true but i am as well acquainted with him as if i had been seeing him an age some people we know at a glance others we never know said clement dryly

to which of these classes does dr leighton belong asked regenia

to both of them answered clement one knows enough of dr leighton to thoroughly detest him the first time he sees him he would not know more if he made him the study of a lifetime

you are bitter said regenia the doctor has his faults perhaps but perhaps the rest of us are not faultless some of us are better than we seem she added

clement was bitter he was standing where he could look into dr leightons face when lotus saved regenia and clement declared to lotus afterward that dr leighton bit his lips with suppressed rage when in the nick of time his cousin was rescued

it was five oclock when the party arrived at the elms  before they left however they had persuaded the girls to attend the grand finale at fra ternity hall

fraternity hall was a study on the evening of the banquet as carriage after carriage drove up and their occupants alighted and tripped into the hall they looked and without doubt were the equals in appointments and bearing of any americans the ladies were attired in evening costume the men wore the conventional black here was to be seen the afroamerican at his best the absence of flashy dress and cheap showy jewelry so often attributed to the negro as a necessity on all public occasions was nowhere to be seen this is evidently not the class from which the usual american writer draws his characters when moralizing upon the peculiarities of the afroamerican the unprejudiced observer would have seen nothing in the appearance of the happy assembly congregated in fraternity hall complexion excepted to indicate that he was among a strange people the banquet in style and arrangements was a model of the highest rather than the lowest class of american affairs

the average afroamerican has little inclinanation to copy the pace of those of his own financial class but at heart he is an aristocrat and imitates the bluest blood in the land

the ladies were there in all their glory and as they promenade or whirl through the figures of the dance what a picture for cosmopoly women as fair as the lily cling to the arms of their ebony othellos with an air of entire satisfaction here is seen in happy association the union of every family of menâan ocular demonstration of the fact that from one blood god hath made all the nations of the earth the social standards adopted by these people and the link that holds together a race so varied in appearance and origin is character the mind not the man the heart not the features nor does this distinction argue that all social lines in afroamerica are obliterated among these people as elsewhere the marks of class difference are severely drawn but worth not complexion forms the barrier of demarcation it is from the point of public observation that writers like w d howells and others fall into an excusable error

as all classes of afroamericans seem to mingle indiscriminately at public functions it is often concluded that no line of separation exists the initiated know better it was noticeable on this occasion as it is in all public gatherings that the same persons made up a given set after each interval of the dance there was indeed a change of partners but no change of the company frequently one or two sets by especial arrangement interchanged partners this then is the fine shading of distinction unostentatiously made that is entirely unnoticed by the casual observer each company of dancers form in themselves a social world undoubtedly satisfactory to themselves but as free from invasion from without as if the dance was being conducted in a private parlor nothing is done or said which would lead a lookeron to suppose that a whits difference existed between any one of these sets and the score of others that surrounded them but should someone beyond the pale of the social world attempt to inflict his company upon them the dancers would become promenaders and the dancing in that part of the hall become a thing of the past

the merrymakers were in the full tide of enjoyment when lucile and regenia chaperoned by mrs levitt arrived at the hall clement st john seated in the balcony for the first time during the conclave was taking notes of the occasion notices of the banquet could not be copied from other papers the racy descriptions of costumes and those who wore them required the skill of someone who not only viewed the proceedings but enjoyed a personal acquaintance with the tastes and peculiarities of the persons described he was well aware that the patrons of his paper would be more interested in a detailed account of the doings of the last evening than in all that preceded it lotus stone as if to make up for the time lost in the afternoon was determined not to miss a number after looking in vain for lucile and regenia who were to come by preference under the care of mrs levitt lotus had concluded that they would not be present and giving wings to his longings entered heartily into the pleasures of the evening clement also had despaired of the appearance of his muchexpected friends and busily observing a gentleman from his dress a representative of the cloth he failed to see the party from the elms come in and seat themselves immediately behind the quilldriver it was evident to clement that the man wanted to talk so closing his note book he concluded to engage him

i suppose you are enjoying this sight elder in common with the rest of us philistines said clement smiling quizzically

i am here but i cannot say i enjoy anything so foolish as dancing rejoined the elder in his deepest chest tones

if you do not enjoy it why are you here asked clement still smiling

i am here sir for the banquet what i think is this there should be no dancing until the supper is over so that those to whom dancing is insulting sir yes i repeat it insulting sir he said as clement raised his eyebrows slightly could go about their business and leave ephraim to his idols he concluded with a snort

did you not know that there would be dancing tonight asked clement

what puzzles me said clement slowly is why you ministers accept complimentary tickets to affairs of this kind well knowing that your feelings will be outraged and then have the impoliteness to come here and mar the pleasure of everyone who comes in contact with you by your caustic criticism of the management if you are opposed to this sort of thing why trifle with your conscience by coming and then raise the devil after you get here because you did come

young man your observations are insulting âinsulting sir in the extreme said the elder rising

they are true all the same said clement and you are under no compulsion to hear more of them

i am cognizant of that replied the now exasperated elder as he beat a hasty retreat to repeat his tale of woe to more sympathizing ears

you are very severe said lucile leaning over his shoulder

ah ladies said mr st john now the very pink of politeness i did not know that such distinguished auditors graced my little tilt with the elder

your directness left no doubt of your meaning the elder could not accuse you of a want of clearness said regenia laughing at the picture which the rev mr foggs made as he left clement in high disgust

well i was perhaps a trifle too outspoken but i hate hypocrisy in any garb if ministers will pervade what they are pleased to style the precincts of satan they must accept the courtesies which obtain there i hold if a man accepts an invitation to attend a social gathering he is under obligations to conduct himself in keeping with the laws of good form he need not participate in what passes if his conscience or inclination forbids but he ought either to contribute to the good cheer of those who invited him or stay at home impoliteness is as sinful as dancing

is dancing a sin asked regenia

that is a question for theologians not newspaper men i refer you to elder foggs said clement smiling at his own wit

are you not a believer mr st john asked mrs levitt with considerable warmth

i should be sorry if i were not mrs levitt if there is nothing beyond this world life at its best is a disappointing farce but i am far from an authority upon matters of the soul he added lightly

the good elder would agree with you i dare say upon your last proposition said regenia

mr stone has forgotten that it was partly through his solicitation that we are here tonight out of sight out of mind is the motto of you men the world over said lucile

do you mean me or is present company the honorable exception clement asked

are you a man she asked laughingly

i pose for one on election day replied clement

mr stone is enjoying himself and he is right we do not have a banquet every evening observed regenia

lotus is a devoted dancer but i fear he would lose his fondness if he knew how fortunate and happy i am stowed away beyond the sullying influence of the maddened multitude

you may be happy but by the way you glance down at your unfinished notes you do not have that appearance laughed lucile

mr st john must finish his notes when he has more leisure for the present he is our captive and although we may bore him we are determined to appropriate him for the rest of the evening said regenia with more boldness than usual

was ever man a more willing captive you are only to demand i await your pleasure said clement what will you have me to do only suggest something sufficiently difficult to make my efforts equal the labors of hercules

little things well done give to life its spice said regenia first tell regenia who the petite beauty is with whom mr stone is dancing so entrancingly queried lucile with a provoking smile at regenia

you are to satisfy luciles curiosity i have no interest in the matter said regenia

oh yes you have dear you can not dream of the awful looks you have been casting in that direction for the last five minutes tell her mr st john she is dying to know

lucile is more anxious than i am tell her and i will admit that i am not at all averse to listening said regenia blushing

clement informed them of the person in question and also of the other ladies in the circle of which lotus stone formed the central figure throwing in such scraps of personal knowledge as he knew or could invent as he chatted away in his interesting way the music suddenly ceased and from the stir among the lookers on it was evident that the procession was about to be formed to make a raid upon the supper room

with serious misgivings that he had forgotten entirely the ladies from the elms clement glanced wistfully over the hall for lotus

shall we go down he at last asked i think we would better if we wish to even see the tables

i do not care for the supper but i should liked to have seen the tables said regenia her very tone indicating her disappointment

if i had lotus i think i could teach him some sense clement thought he said why not go down the sight of four hundred guests is worth seeing because so rare

mrs levitt signifies her intention of remaining where she is i have eaten one supper and do not care to eat again she said

pardon me clement heard in the low tones of lotus as he turned for a last look for his friend i know i do not deserve your forgiveness but have you been here long

only about two hours said clement with a visble touch of irony

so long asked lotus come let us get our places in the ranks and i will explain my seeming perfidy as we march he remarked to regenia nothing abash

the officers of the grand commandery and their ladies placed according to rank preceded the procession clement representing the press came just behind them he did not therefore hear what explanation lotus made of his apparent neglect but before the doors of the supper room were opened he noticed regenia talking as gaily as if the affair of which he was ready to make a cause of war had never happened

after marching and countermarching several times around the room the procession is at last formed the eminent grand commander escorting the mayor leads the way as they approach the banquet hall the doors are thrown open and the guests pass in seating themselves at the long tables the grand commander at the head of the first table the mayor of mt clare at his right at a given signal a tall whitehaired man in the uniform of the knights eloquently gives thanks regenia was delighted she had never been so many afroamericans under similar circumstances and judging from the sparkle of her eyes and the tinge of her cheeks the introduction was at least pleasing mr stone keenly cognizant of an apparent want of gallantry exerted himself to make amends it was well for regenia that her first contact with afroamerican society was under circumstances so felicitous it was a rare combination of sparkling wit brilliant humor and biting sarcasm which sat that night about the eminent grand commanders end of the table gallant sir knights all they were men of influence known and respected throughout the land

she is yet to see the other side where ignorance is as pronounced as absence of it was conspicuous in the gay circle which surrounded her

as everything comes to an end so the feasting was at last finished the toast master taking his station began to read the toasts of the evening they were such as are customary upon such occasions the responses with a few noteworthy exceptions were listened to with indifference if not to say impatience

mr st john spoke for the press his effort was happily conceived uniquely delivered and well received

lotus stone made an ideal postprandial address the ladies god bless them was the toast regenia sat throughout the address in a maze of happy surprises such a torrent of mellifluous rhapsodies flowed from the lips of mr stone that the audience interrupting burst forth time and again in uproarious applause he closed with a glowing burst of eloquence complimentary to the noble selfsacrificing women of his race in such pleasing contrast to the airy nothingness strung out on such occasions that every woman listening felt thankful for his earnest advocacy of their cause mr stone was surrounded by the ladies as he made his way back to the ball room congratulations greeted him on every side regenia alone seemed to have lost her tongue from the moment lotus stone charmed and delighted that audience compelled attention where older and more experienced men had signally failed the world contained for regenia underwood but one man and that fortunate creature if he could only have known it was the hero of the hour

soon after supper the party from the elms returned home lotus and clement escorted them to their carriage as the carriage whirled around the corner shutting out forever the glow of electric lights streaming from the hall regenia softly sighed it occurred to her that years would come and go before the streets of mt clare would again echo with the tramp of marching knights as they drove homeward an unaccountable silence seemed to settle over them all even lucile was quiet

was it a premonition of the future looking backward and infringing its shadow upon the present

the office of dr frank leighton was called the hub of seven corners four streets converged to form the circle in the centre of which stood his office like the hub of a wheel the drugstore on one corner ended the square like the apex of a triangle each of the other three blocks was in the form of a trapezoid whose lesser base faced the circle

although a physician dr leighton did not practice medicine as the ordinary acceptation of the term implies he was a specialistâa specialist of symptoms

five friends graduated from an eastern medical college eight years previous to the events which we are transcribing one evening near the close of their medical course the friends met to engage in a farewell supper as each talked of his intentions and hopes one of them was inclined to take a discouraging view of the whole subject he expatiated upon the barren results which usually attended the administration of medicine to the cure of diseases he made a singular proposal and thereon hangs a tale he said that as medicine had been almost vivisected by the introduction of specialties why not end the agony and make one that would cover all of them he proposed to divide the followers of aesculapius into two general divisions the first to devote their entire time to the diagnosis of diseases the second to their treatment the work of the first class to end when the condition of the patient was ascertained the second class to cure the derangement if it be not beyond the reach of science

the five doctors being men of means decided to go to europe and take a postgraduate course they subsequently put this decision into practice by spending three years abroad two of them bending their energies to the causes and symptoms of diseases the other three to the cure of ailments it was a part of the plan to give to difficult surgical operations the united wisdom of the five when these doctors returned to their native land mt clare was chosen as the best site to begin the new departure the size of the place had much to do with the selection the city was divided into three districts with an office of a specialist ofcures in each the hub of seven corners was the location of the office of the specialists of symptoms the system which at first would seem unwieldy and expensive was offset by the superior skill of the practitioners at the time of our story the specialist of symptoms had gained an enviable reputation by their unerring correctness in diagnosis nor was their success more pronounced than their brother specialists who had reaped a rich harvest from the increase of patients their skill had secured the resident physicians had at first ridiculed the scheme as the invention of quacks but failing in their attempt to laugh the specialists out of the city had finally combined in a similar arrangement dr frank leighton was the mouthpiece and inspiration of the new fraternity a handsome well born southern gentleman he gained and held an enviable reputation it has been previously mentioned that he was a nephew of mrs underwood and regenia excepted the only direct heir to her property this fact had due weight in the choice of mt clare as the place best suited to introduce his much cherished innovation in the field of medical reform having determined to cutivate the good graces of his aunt his suavity had early installed him as a prime favorite in her affections hardly a day passed that he did not find time to drive out to the elms his movements had long since ceased to be a matter of concern to the family so thoroughly did he ingratiate himself mrs underwood sought his advice in nearly every change she made in the management of her affairs

regenia liked him also he was frank and jovial with her in that degree men of experience find it so easy to be with girls of her years as he sat in his office on the morning after the boat ride dr leighton was in any other than an amiable mood he had a wellbred mans feelings after a nights reflection upon the fact that he has behaved badly he wondered if regenia had observed what must have been so manifest to her new found friends

her friends he repeated with a haughty smile what right have these impertinent illborn dogs to be her friends he asked himself then it occurred to him if their friendship had been as cold as his actions had been contemptible where would have been the sweet girl today who white and fearful yesterday stood in such imminent danger the very thought increased his hatred of lotus stone in his heart he knew lotus had performed an act of bravery for regenia at the risk of his own life which alone saved the girl from a premature death but what right had he to meddle anyway what right had this spawn of an outcast race to cross the path and thwart the purposes of his betters inwardly cursing himself for his own meanness but despising lotus for virtues the doctor did not possess he arose and taking his hat from the rack entered the phaeton standing at the door and drove slowly out to the elms

his distemper was not to be improved by a visit to his aunt before he reached his destination he heard with rankling detestation the merry laughter which the witty sallies of clement st john were provoking as with the young girls and lotus stone he lounged lazily beneath the inviting shade the tender mouth of his horse felt the hate which the doctor could not otherwise express as with a sudden jerk he stopped the faithful animal in front of mrs underwoods gate

he greeted the party under the trees with a slight inclination of the head and angrily stalked into the house he went directly to the library where mrs underwood usually passed the morning hours after greeting her he said in his light and airy way i see our friends still remain they must enjoy the unaccustomed hospitality of their lately found acquaintances

i suppose so answered mrs underwood with a smile

i presume the surroundings are a trifle more luxurious than they habitually find one ought to forgive them for making the most of their opportunities he said a little bitterly as he glanced out of the window where our friends all unconscious of the hatred their free and easy ways were kindling in the bosom of the master of the hub passed the hours in innocent conversation

regenia is happy said mrs underwood it is her first real contact with the world she must some day know

dr leighton inwardly winced but wisely held his tongue

as i see how she delights in the company of her race i feel a thrill of satisfaction that i kept nothing hid from her she knows who she is and seems to gravitate toward the inevitable with the instinct of destiny

i should be sorry to think dear aunt that the destiny of regenia pointed in the direction you indicate he answered with a toss of his head toward the lawn

and why not she asked somewhat piqued by the doctors reply

what do any of us know of these men would you have been as free to allow your ownâ he checked himselfâyour own dear friends to drift into an intimate acquaintance with people utter strangers to you until the last few days are you less solicitous for regeniasfuture than you would be for any other voung woman similarly situated

do not go too far doctor said mrs underwood noticeably aroused by his insinuations i fear you forget yourself regenia and lucile have been friends from infancy lucile introduced her friend mr st tohn and he in turn introduced his friend mr stone i do not think it necessary in this case to demand a certificate of character

very true but i enjoy a more extensive acquaintance with that class of people than you do i have lived among them all my life i know that only about one in every ten thousand is trustworthy you must excuse my solicitude for the child he said assuming an injured look

oh well we differ upon that subject and as you are settled in your opinion discussion would be worse than useless you estimate people by your prejudice i do not i have no fears for regenias immediate safety i think her fully capable of taking care of herself

and yet her mother was not said the doctor excitedly

wrong with her mother is right with her said mrs underwood rising with an evident effort to maintain her selfcontrol as she excused herself and left the room the doctor had no doubt that he had indeed gone too far not a little chagrined at mrs underwoods failure to accept his advice he could not resist the inclination to stop awhile under the shade of the elms and make one of the company pleasantly conversing there he surmised that his presence would be no particular pleasure to clement and lotus but that fact only served to whet his curiosity his hatred was a sufficient incentive to nerve his resolution

i need hardly ask if you are finding sufficient amusement to drive dull care away said dr leighton accepting a campstool offered him by regenia and resting his hat on the grass as he sat down in the midst of the merrimakers

mr st john has been delighting us with some of his droll experiences said regenia laughing heartily as she recalled the story just related by mr st john

i am sorry that i am too late to laugh with you said the doctor

tell dr leighton about the bootblack who found your report of a wedding mr st john said regenia

i have too much respect for the doctors age and experience to repeat a stale story for his amusement i can not bear to tell a story unless i am certain it will amuse i do not doubt the doctors sense of the ridiculous but my ability to reach it said clement dryly

repeat the story and i promise to laugh whether it is droll or dry said the doctor

that would be insincerity i would not tempt you to act a part clement replied

the world is a stage and all of us are actors you have been cast for light comedy today act well your part there all the honor lies replied the doctor

comedy and tragedy daily rehearsed make the annals of all our lives today it is comedy yesterday almost tragedy i am happy today whenever i compare it with yesterday was not that the most marvelous escape doctor clement asked

very indeed the doctor answered rising i fear you are not going to tell me the story it must have been rich or at least miss underwood seemed to think so as he said this he turned on his heel and hastened to his phaeton as he drove away he registered a vow in his heart that those impertinent cusses should never spend another day at the elms the place some day will have a different master and then none of that class emphasizing that with a contemptuous sneer shall ever stretch their legs under those trees

clement st john smiled triumphantly as the last glimpse of dr leighton disappeared from view regenia wondered why the doctor had addressed her as miss underwood

lotus was first to break the silence doctor leighton is a relation of mrs underwoods i believe said lotus

her nephew answered regenia

is he always so consequential clement enquired

why did you not tell him the story regenia asked ignoring his question

i reserve my stories for those who wish to hear them i never pretend what i do not feel dr leighton had no desire to hear anything i had to say he is your friend perhaps but worship of you would never make me even respect him

dr leighton was politeness itself this morning i am sure interrupted lucile

say patronizing it fits the condition better when you speak of dr leighton dr leightons politeness is from above downward as the lord is to his footman but never as an equal is to an equal it is hard to be other than ones self and retain ones respect for himself said clement apologetically

time flies said lotus we leave on the evening boat and have ever so much to attend to before we shall be ready to start i must therefore beseech mr st john to cut short his homily and hope at some time more opportune he may have leisure to finish it said lotus pleasantly

you have hours and hours before the night steamer leaves for minton but i suppose you have other places to call said regenia

to this implied question lotus made no reply

he held out his hand first to lucile with the remark for the present i must say goodbye

say your farewells to mrs underwood and mrs levitt said lucile we expect to be at the boat we want to see the last of everybody she added with a merry laugh

goodbyes twice said are harbingers of happy meetings in the near future said lotus

it is to be hoped in this case said lucile with a mischievous look at regenia

and i say amen from the depth of my heart chimed in clement

after they had bade the other members of the family adieu the young men took their leave the girls accompanying them to the gate as lotus held in his own the pretty hand of regenia he could not help wishing that some day under circumstances more binding he might claim it as his own

our two friends were among the last detachment of knights to leave mt clare the great multitude had returned on the carrier pigeon at an early hour that morning the grand officers and a selected few of the other distinguished visitors the majority of whom were from the far away southland had lingered until the last possible moment drinking to its very dregs the delights of this the happiest reunion of their knightly organization promptly at nine oclock the beautiful city of athens unloosed her cables and turned her prow toward the distant lake

the night was perfect the rays of the full moon touched with fairy fingers the sparkling waters in tints of purest silver streaming far in the wake of the steamer the recently disturbed water glittered in the soft moonlight like a tremulous phosphorescent sea the party above referred to occupied chairs in the aft recess each filled with his own thoughts conversation lagged

mr st john as usual broke the silence that is the last of mt clare he remarked half to himself

i thought we had left mt clare long enough ago said lotus stone

no i have been sitting here watching the last light as it grew smaller until just before i spoke it closed its weary eye like a sleepy child and sank to rest beyond my visual horizon

i was watching the same light but i missed it some time since said colonel stanton your eyes are younger than mine st john he continued

a few years younger i suppose but yours like the great george washingtons have grown dim in the service of your country said clement complimentary

dont put such ideas into colonel stantons head said the eminent grand commander laughingly you will have him applying for an increase of pension we have too many militia colonels on the pay roll of the government as it is

at this witty thrust at the colonels title the coterie about the table burst into hilarious laughter

thats on me said the colonel dryly come in and have something gentlemen

no one can be dry when contemplating so much water answered the eminent grand commander j we dont drink overly much water in my state we have a nameless void that yawns for old kentucky bourbon said colonel stanton

colonel stanton said clement you live in the south and on business or pleasure you have spent a great deal of time in the north from your standpoint what is the difference between the two sections

there are many sides to your question young man said the colonel thoughtfully a conservative intelligent afroamerican will do well enough in either section nine times out of ten it is the man rather than the part of country in which he happens to live that tells for his future i agree with you in that statement of course said clement but what differences if any do you observe between the north and south there is a marked difference but to my way of thinking it is from within rather than from without bear in mind i speak of the intelligent conservative man in the south such a man knows he is a virtuous citizen but feels that the majority of his fellow citizens doubt it in the north such a citizen feels that he is a man and that opinion is strengthened and encouraged by the knowledge that the majority of his fellow citizens take the same view of the subject

what other men sinnerslike myself think of my actions would have nothing to do with the case the consciousness of a correct life is its own best reward said lotus stone

we are not splitting ethical hairs young man said the colonel virtue may be its own best reward but to feel that every other man you meet regards you as an unhung villain is not the most encouraging incentive to moral excellence to feel that an unwritten presumption of guilt before the facts are known constantly hangs above ones head takes from the best of us that substantial aid which we all need to stem the current of temptations which we hourly meet

what our people need in the south and everywhere else is more independence we are too docile too subservient said lotus stone

you speak well but not by the card said the colonel their independence in one respect was their undoing if after freedom came the former slave had sought the paternal care of his late owner the master class would have defended him against the cruel indignities of the poor whites to the last dropbe it said to the never dying credit of the negro that when the shackels fell from his limbs he stepped forth in the power of his new found manhood to sink or swim by individual effort he rightly chose the perils of freedom to the vassalage of a patron

more than fifty exchanges edited by afroamericans reach my office weekly said clement what i am at a loss to understand is why these papers so frequently deny or excuse the wrongs perpetrated against our people in the south they often take me to task for flagellatting american civilization in general and that part of it south of mason and dixons line in particular it cannot be that these journalists are not cognizant of the truth of my assertions

 breathes there a man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said this is my own my native land  said colonel stanton these southern afroamericans are as indignant over the outrages occurring daily in their midst as their brothers in the north but there is a note of patronizing pity in the tone of northern sympathy extremely exasperating to a southerner ones country is his country however unkindly it may treat him the afroamerican south loves his home notwithstanding its unjust discriminations his state pride indigenous to southern soil often gets the better of his judgment said the colonel laughingly

how an afroamerican of any intelligence can find anything in this country to be proud of is an enigma to me said another member of the party i agree with one of our great leaders that no negro should ever sing my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty while a condition more revolting than slavery exists in the country

that is the purest nonsense said lotus excitedly the country in which a man is born is his country if there are wrongs to redress it is his duty to labor to right them all the rights any other citizen can claim are not mine by special legislation but by birthright my country tis of thee i sing and whether i sing it or not it is my country and there is no possible way to divorce myself from it except i leave it and swear allegiance to another flag

well we can leave it and the day will come when we shall turn to africa our native land with eagerness remarked the other gentleman

if anybody wants to go to africa let him go but africa as a native land for the american negro is a myth a great bishop may plant and the colonization society may water but the population of africa will never be materially increased from the ranks of the afroamerican said lotus

do you not believe that some day our people will return to africa

yes when every jew goes back to the jordan when every englishman returns to the thames when every irishman goes back to the shannon every frenchman to the seine every italian to the tiber and every german to the rhine then the afroamerican may sit down and seriously think of returning to the congo

we shall never gain our fight for equal manhood by running off to africa but i admit that i grow discouraged and heart sick as i read of some fresh disregard for the commonest rights of men enacted with impunity every day in the south it is a red letter day when some man guilty or innocent is not lynched the most disgraceful side of the question is the equanimity with which the country receives the news of the most inhuman lynching the press simply notes the fact as an item of news with here and there an editor possessing the rare temerity to comment the church is as dumb as an duster upon the injustice practiced in our own country but alive and able to hold indignation meetings and circulate petitions to the czar of all the russias for the alleviation of the condition of his subjects said clement growing more indignant as he continued to talk

lynch law is a foul blot upon the escutcheon of our civilization said colonel stanton slowly no enlightened european government would tolerate lynching

but can it be stopped until the moral character of the people rises above such illegal actions who can argue with a mob asked lotus

powder and lead said clement rising and moving about to suppress his excitement give them what they giveâmob the mobbers

that is brave talk considering your distance from the arena of daily disturbance but just so long as the conscience of a people is so callous that it finds entertainment in seeing human beings roasted alive with all the eclat of a political barbecue such people need missionaries rather than cold lead the persecutors are more to be pitied than their victims replied lotus seriously

christianity wealth and education will some day lift a cultured american negro to the status accorded an ignorant italian remarked the eminent grand commander sarcastically

christianity wealth and education are great levelers began colonel stanton but they have failed utterly to fill the requirements in this country christianity seldom rises above the masses that profess it as a theory it is simply sublime if those who claim to follow christ acted upon the precepts he taught then earth would be a paradise christianity north and south has done wonders for the afroamerican but while the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing even the power of christianity is unable to turn them from their purpose wealth is helping to beat down prejudice the man who owns a home however humble is doing more to eliminate the unknown quantity that is necessary before the problem is solved than the  orator who delivers a vehement phillipic education of the right kind is also an important factor while it helps us it also deepens the hatred of the ignorant masses against us

i have always believed said clement that the solution of this perplexing question is not moral material nor intellectual but the essence of the threeâpolitical the palladium of equality in a republic is the ballot the badge of citizenship is the right to vote it is the citizens only protection without it he becomes a political nondescript at the mercy of every demagogue who bids for popular favor by preaching a crusade of prejudice the nonvoting citizen is the only person who can be maltreated with impunity men who vote elect judges legislators and governors and if these officers forget the interests of their constituents they receive a painful reminder when they again aspire for office would a legislature responsible to all the people pass a separate coach law sanction lynching permit every kind of indignity to be put upon an inoffensive people not if the people knew their rights the equality of citizenship which is the foundation stone of our political fabric promises to every native born freeman the same rights by our laws if a man is a citizen he must be the equal of every other citizen since our laws do not recognize the supremacy of one class above another and therefore whatever right any other citizen enjoys is his by the common law of equals

how can an afroamerican vote when the constitutional amendments are null and void asked lotus

what have the amendments to do with it anyway the afroamericans right to citizenship is not based upon the amendments but upon nativity and freedom if a man is born in a country and is free or ever afterward becomes free that birthright entitles him to citizenship the amendments were the officers that enabled us to get our rights but our citizenship rights are interwoven through the conception and structural erection of constitutional government clement concluded

that is at least a new presentation of an old subject i must think it over said colonel stanton rising you young men can settle this question between you he added i believe i will retire

all the company except clement and lotus followed the gay old colonel into the cabin

the two young men sat there until far into the night discussing future plans building air castles destined before many months or years to tumble about their heads at last as if at a loss for something more to say or new to propose they sought their state rooms to live again in a land of dreams the experiences of the past week

it was late on the morning after the scene described in a previous chapter when lucile and regenia made their appearance at the breakfast table the fierce rays of an august sun had been gilding the turrets and spires of the beautiful little city between the inland seas for more than two hours all night the rain had been falling and the evidences of holiday attire of which the city had not entirely disrobed herself hung limp and unpicturesque from the wilting effects of the last nights down pour

the reaction from nearly a week of continuous gaiety was plainly discernible as the two young ladies seated themselves to partake of their mornings repast

well how do you feel the morning after said mrs levitt in her pleasant way

very well indeed answered lucile except perhaps a little duller and heavier than usual an overdose of pleasure always leaves one with a sense of hollow pain you see regenia you are not quite up to this sort of thing and ought not to have been given such a lions share at initiation

you would better take that admonition individually if we except the late hours i was obliged to keep my part has been anything else but lionlike said regenia

do not look so solemn you will ruin your digestion said lucile with a merry laugh if you did not act the lions part you did duty as lamb very acceptably being saved and taking the greatest pains to be rescued by the very nicest young man that attended the conclave she continued in her tantalizing way as i had to be rescued said regenia catching some of luciles buoyant spirits providence seemed to have chosen my savior with a singleness which i could not have improved upon had i personally supervised the list

nor could a braver more unselfish deed have been done i shall love mr stone all of my life for that one act of disinterested goodness replied lucile with one of her instant transfers from playful chaffing to sober earnestness

what would mr st john think of that avowal i wonder asked mrs levitt smiling with conscious satisfaction of her own depth

he would applaud that opinion mr st john never tires of praising the good qualities of his friend said lucile trying to look uninterested but feeling decidedly uncomfortable under mrs levitts knowing smile

and so would any other man or woman whose heart is in the right place i am too grateful to mr stone to know how to express my appreciation of his gallant conduct but mr st john would have been equally as noble replied regenia as a kind of echo to the preceding thought

it is such a grand thing to be a man anyway said lucile seriously a good man has unbounded opportunities to help everybody men are not hedged about with rules of conduct as women are our sphere of usefulness is so often circumscribed by the fact of sex

that is rather a strange admission to come from you lucile said regenia i thought you were inclined to be strong minded

and so i am in every respect that is womanly i believe thoroughly in women preparing themselves for useful positions and filling them with the same skill as men but i do not think a woman can ever be a man when a woman attempts that she looses the graces of her own sex without attaining the powers of the sex to which she aspires said lucile rising

regenia made no answer but motioning lucile to follow led the way to a hammock beneath the trees

do you know said regenia as she threw herself lazily into the hammock that i was haunted all night with premonitions of evilâand i had the strangest dream

tell me your dream i have the gift of second sight said lucile archly

i never pay any attention to dreams nor do i think anything will come of this but it seems to hang to me this morning with the persistency of fate replied regenia soberly

i am waiting very patiently to hear your dream said lucile and when i do hear it i shall weave about it all the mysteries of the sibyl very well put on the air impenetrable take my hand as they do in the story books cross it twice stare into vacancy and i will to you a tale unfold that will ruffle your spirits for the rest of the day said regenia pleasantly

how is this said lucile as she assumed an attitude corresponding as nearly as possible with regenias suggestions

excellent said regenia now i will begin i dreamed she said dropping into a low earnest key that mr st john you and i were standing in the public square watching a sort of wild west parade at mr st johns suggestion we started to move along with the crowd to the place where the exhibition was to be given you and i arminarm and mr st john a few feet behind us as a sort of rear guard to keep the crowd from jostling us we had walked along in this way for some time when looking around mr st john had disappeared and we were unable to stop to find him or to extricate ourselves from the mass of human beings who pushed us steadily onward at last in order to escape the crowd and if possible find our way back home we stepped off the sidewalk into the street here surrounded by indians buffaloes dogs and ponies we walked along as part of the pageant we finally came to a dense woods and wandering forward we hoped to come to some place or meet some person we knew growing tired and hungry we sat down on the body of a fallen oak and began to cry we had been sitting there but a few moments when to our consternation we heard the most unearthly noise accompanied by the splashing of water in the near distance

looking in the direction from which the sounds came we saw a long embankment on the top of which ran a rail fence fearing some worse fate would befall us i started in an opposite direction with your usual fearlessness you urged me to go over to the embankment and essayed to lead the way gaining courage from your boldness i accompanied you to the bank where after numberless slips and falls we reached the top we climbed upon the fence and there sitting bolt upright between us as we resumed a vertical position was mr stone he did not speak but as he turned from you to me in his sad eyes and despairing countenance were depicted a world of sorrow that smote me to the heart he gazed out into the lake flanked by the embankment a picture of dejection in the lake as we followed his gaze i saw a huge fish with massive head enormous jaws and capacious mouth snapping up the other inhabitants of the lake as they fled before him the huge leviathan followed his destructive course until he came to the shore on the shore by the side of the lake grazing in unconscious security were the animals belonging to the wild west combination we had left in the woods but the number had increased to a respectable menagerie this fish when he had reached the shore assumed the form of a turtle and rushing from the water crushed first one animal then another until he came to a giraffe which catching in his teeth the huge beast began to make a circuit of the grounds i could hear amidst the wild cries of the terrorstricken animals the grinding sound of the turtles iron jaws as he crushed the giraffe between them suddenly the beast stopped turned toward the place where we were sitting and dropping the lacerated giraffe from his bloody mouth made toward us

in vain we entreated mr stone to fly with us for his life but leave he would not he sat there sadly smiling into the open jaws of approaching death now in the woods near the embankment was a sawmill an incline to carry the lumber down to the lake was between us and the approaching animal i had jumped down form the fence but unable to induce mr stone to leave had resumed my seat fully resolved to die with him as the turtle attempted to cross the track of the incline a heavy car load of lumber caught him beneath its wheels and cut him into a thousand pieces the animals on the shore seeing this burst into a ghostly laugh at the sound of which i awoke

lucile had long since dropped regenias hand in her excitement and with wonderment portrayed in every line of her face gave expression to her astonishment by interjecting after every pause in the story how strange well did you ever i declare i never heard anything like it etc etc

as she was about to ejaculate how strange for the steenth time dr leighton who had been listening to nearly every word of the story said in sepulchral tones and did you marry mr stone and live happily ever after

the girls thus taken by surprise bounded from the hammock with a scream and turning were half vexed to see who the unwarrantable intruder was

lucile quickly gained her composure sufficiently to say what a scare you gave us

how long have you been here asked regenia trying hard to hide her vexation

long enough to hear a most amusing story is it original or was it rescued from fairyland

said the doctor with a goodnatured laugh at regenias discomfiture

it was a dream said lucile and you managed to speak just in time to interrupt the grand finale lucile had either forgotten or preferred to ignore the fact that regenia had signified the conclusion of the dream by saying i awoke

oh it was a dream i thought it was one of the good stories your friends seem to keep on ice for special occasions remarked the doctor a trifle sarcastically

it was one of my friends good stories and i am happy to know that i have more than one friend who can tell a good story said lucile turning to regenia with a smile is it not true dear she added

mr st john seemed proof for the occasion yesterday and i doubt not on better acquaintance he would be ample for all demands

has mr st john been shying his castor in more than one direction i thought it was the silent fellow on the fence that you had sworn to never never leave said the doctor as he turned to regenia with a look on his handsome face which would have done credit to the melancholy dane when contemplating whether to be or not to be

it is certainly of no interest to you dr leighton which way mr st john shies his castor whatever that may mean better make sure that he never shies it in your directionâstranger things have happened said lucile with a proud toss of her head

a real gentleman would not seek to mischievously distort a conversation insidiously heard

said regenia rising now unable to further conceal her anger

what a tempest said the doctor laughing heartily at the breeze he had unintentionally stirred up i leave you ladies discomfited and virtually driven from the field he added as he turned away still laughing and went into the house

the girls sat for a time staring after dr leighton when lucile remembering how irresistibly droll dr leighton had looked when talking of the other fellow on the fence burst into a fit of laughter regenia laughed also not that she divined the cause of luciles amusement but because laughter in youth is contagious

well it was too funny of the doctor to come in and spoil the strangest dream i ever heard said lucile when she had ceased to laugh i am not in the spirit to interpret it now a shadow has fallen between us

perhaps the shadow has something to do with the unraveling of the mystery added regenia thoughtfully

perhaps it has who can say do you know i am becoming morbid i shall begin to believe in dreams and ghosts and bogie men pretty soon said lucile

come let us go for a long ride said regenia starting toward the house and by the time we return we shall have driven away from the shadow of a dream

as they passed by the gate a half hour later dr leighton standing beneath the shade of the elms twirling his cane cried after them mind you do not get lost in the woods before you return

if we do we shall expect you along in good time to find the babes in the woods  answered regenia with every vestige of her late anger dispelled

if you come to a high embankment with a rail fence upon it you will find me sitting there waiting he cried as they drove away they heard the silver laugh of dr leighton ringing after them the very index of the pleasure which he felt when contemplating the little war of words he had engaged in with the girls a half hour before

that is the famous seven corners remarked regenia as they drove past dr leightons office seven corners is not a new place but i refer to the office in the centre of the circle

a specialist of symptoms repeated lucile slowly is that not an innovation she asked

yes i believe it originated with dr frank or at least it is being given its first trial under his direction regenia replied

he is a singular man said lucile thoughtfully perhaps he is not so singular either she added apologetically but he is not like other people i am at a loss to classify him what do you think of your cousin anyway she asked after a pause

i am not sure that i think of him at all he is very fond of mrs underwood and is so often at our house that his presence has ceased to arouse conjecture he is very kind to me and i do not know that i find anything about him to especially dislike regenia replied

he is exceedingly polite i admit yet his very politeness causes me to mistrust him his eyes always seem to be laughing at one concluded lucile

that is dear old prospect park she cried dropping dr leighton and his peculiarities without another thought how forsaken it looks

compare it today with the scenes transpiring there about this hour last wednesday said regenia regretfully

what stirring events animated the dreamy old place indeed the vast multitude the gallant knights the inspiring music the competition drill and the numberless other happy incidents that are ineffaceably engraved upon my memory in vivid association with the thoughts of prospect park said lucile

one enjoys recalling happy incidents quite as much as experiencing them i often think added regenia

i enjoy the recollection of them decidedly more the unpleasant incidents which often precede our supremely happy moments can be eliminated or at least minimized during the serene hour that memory unbars her secret chamber for the reception of the joyous past lucile replied

how often said regenia do we make of our by gone pleasures an elysian shrine to which the mind in moments of sorrow fondly turns our golden era is ever behind us

on a little eminence east of the park regenia drew rein and exclaimed see over there among the trees is the very spot from which we observed the drill

and without a very great stretch of imagination i can see mr st john presenting his friend whose easy manners made us feel after an hours acquaintance we had known him for years replied lucile with a smile as they drove on leaving the park and its romantic associations slumbering in the receding distance

we are not far from the river are you going to melton inn she asked after a long pause during which both of them had been busily thinking of the very recent past

no answered regenia we will drive down to the national pike thence across to shady side and follow our old course to the city all right said lucile i believe i will take the lines for the rest of the way

most people wear gloves when driving she remarked as she deftly proceeded to strip hers off but i never could work in kids

as she put her gloves on the cushion between them and took the lines regenia noticed for the first time gleaming from the third finger of luciles left hand a modest solitaire

what a pretty ring she exclaimed with girlish enthusiasm how long have you worn it why did you not show it to me before this one question at a time please said lucile trying to speak with importance but to tell the truth feeling very much confused

and it is a real diamond said regenia holding luciles hand in a position to get a better light on the stone

i think it is ever so pretty said lucile modestly

i think it is beautiful regenia said may i ask who gave it to you

certainly you may but can you not guess asked lucile

mr st john lucile nodded her assent the darling said regenia throwing her arms around luciles neck and from some mysterious cause common to the sex the girls dissolved this sweetest of all secrets in a flood of mutual tears

the horse which drew the phaeton either in dumb sympathy or from long acquaintance with the eccentricities of young women stopped short in the middle of the road during this lachrymal performance

and when is it all to be asked regenia her curiosity getting the better of the shock luciles sudden revelation had occasioned no wonder you had so much faith in mr st john she added laughingly

as they drove back home lucile unfolded her plans they were to be married in october and thereafter the typewriter was to be transferred from the office in which she is employed at present to a less pretentious building controlled by the proprietor of the events to all of her plans regenia gave her unqualified approval not that she knew anything about them but because they filled her friends ideal of happiness regenia was in no mood to criticise any measure this independent successful girl proposed

when they returned to the elms they found that dinner had been awaiting them for some time

you must have taken a long drive said mrs underwood who met them at the door it is half past fiveâthirty minutes after the dinner hour and you have not even been to luncheon lucile must be nearly famished regenia will starve you dear she seems to forget that her visitors might wish some times to stop listening to her talk and eat something

lucile can eat any time but she will not have another opportunity to talk to me again soon so we are obliged to improve every moment replied regenia

no danger of starving in such a land of plenty said lucile with a complaisant smile your bread shall be given and your water shall be sure we are taught is not that prophetic as well as proverbial regenia

so mr st john says and of course there is nothing worth while knowing that he does not know answered regenia as they sat down to dinner

after dinner and until a late hour that night the girls passed the time out under the trees regenia asking questions concerning the coming wedding and lucile gratifying her excusable curiosity by laying bare all of her intentions preparatory to this most important event as it was saturday evening and lucile must return to minton the following night the girls resolved to be up at an early hour the next morning in order to make the last day as long as possible agreeable to their resolution they arose sabbath morning long before mrs levitt who prided herself upon the fact that she awoke a little earlier upon gods day as she called it than on any other

lucile proposed that regenia go with her to church a proposal the latter accepted with eagerness the underwoods had always strictly adhered to the episcopal church mrs levitt reared as she was in canada was also a communicant of the church of england regenia therefore had rarely attended any other service than those at st marks but a short distance from her own door

if lucile had belonged to the church toward which she was most inclined she would have been an ardent church woman she had often accompanied regenia to st marks and frequently regretted that her own people as well as the majority of her friends were satisfied with a less pretentious church and a simpler form of worship

on this sabbath morning regenias anxiety to go was heightened by the incidents of the past week and it will reveal no secret to suspect that thoughts of the future played no unimportant part what woman lives who does not dream of some future in which an ideal man forms at least a shadowy background

the two friends were among the first to arrive at the place of worship although regenia had been assured that services commenced a full half hour later than at st marks her constant fear of committing that most heinous breach of good form tardiness at worship caused her to quicken her pace sufficiently to be in her seat at the ringing of the first bell just as regenias patience was about exhausted the organ voluntary followed immediately by the minister taking his place in the pulpit assured her that the service had begun the music was simple but regenia thought it was sung with a pathetic sweetness unequaled in all her experience after the reading singing and prayer the minister arose he was tall and somewhat inclined to stoop as black as ebony his features were sharp and well proportioned his hair as white as driven snow apparently old judging from his white locks his black eyes had lost none of their fire his voice none of its pathos it was plain that nature had carved him for a ruler his text was from the psalms his theme gods protecting care regenia listened like one entranced the minister stepping in front of the small stand on which sat a glass of water beside the open bible spoke without notes his voice at first low but wonderfully distinct gained strength and power as the theme unfolded he related incident after incident of gods protecting care regenia thought she could see his countenance soften his eyes brighten and the very man himself gradually living through the scenes he so eloquently described the auditors were wrapped in attention and it did not occur to herthatan occasional amen from some of the older members marred the interest but she felt rather thankful that someone had the forethought to express audibly that approval in which her heart so readily acquiesced when the minister had concluded regenia found herself wondering where this man obtained his unusual wisdom and fluency of speech how she thought could a people whose aspirations had been beaten down beneath the earth in a few short years rise from their degraded condition to such rapturous flights of burning convincing thought whence this power she asked herself she took refuge in the oftrepeated scripture gods ways are not our ways verily out of the mouths of banes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise what a long weary way she thought from the slave pen to this pulpit and yet this whitehaired angel of god was there and a consummate master of his position thus she sat musing until awakened from her reverie by the congregation rising to sing the closing hymn again regenia was fortunate in seeing the afroamerican at his best she was delighted with the service she was as delighted with its simplicity as lucile was with the solemn grandeur of the episcopal forms after the service lucile at regenias request introduced her to the minister as they walked home regenia talked of nothing but their mornings experience and again and again expressed her intentions in the future to hear the same kind of inspiring truth from the same pulpit

lucile was silent but she thought how often in going home from st marks she had wished that fortune had permitted her to attend such a service every sabbath after all is it only the unusual which attracts

lucile with many regrets and after many a locked embrace left for minton on the evening boat that night after mrs levitt and regenia returned from the landing they sat on the steps of the veranda and talked for hours before going into the house it was a glorious night the moonlight fell through the trees with a soft but broken radiance upon regenia seated at the feet of her fostermother her beautiful head resting childlike in the old womans lap

are you tired my dear asked mrs levitt at the same time turning her face up to her own my my how you favor your mother if you did not have your fathers sad brown eyes i would think you were that poor child risen from the dead she continued thoughtfully

am i so much like my mother how i wish i could remember her said regenia sadly i miss her now more than ever before it seems to me that the older i grow the more i long for mother

well do i remember her said mrs levitt slowly she was but a child you might say when she came to my house though older than you she had grown up in an atmosphere widely different from the one she had entered yet through it all i believe she was happy how she loved your father and how he petted and spoiled her i cooked their wedding dinner and lived in sight of them until sheâ mrs levitt hesitated and then in a broken voice continued until they brought you here before your mother died she put you in my arms and after kissing you oh so fondly whispered be a mother to my baby after i had promised to do as she requested she closed her eyes and breathed her last said the old lady wiping away the tears that chased each other down her wrinkled cheeks

it has been my prayer day and night she said after a pause that you may some day be as good a woman as your mother

regenia buried her head in mrs levitts lap and they wept together over the memories of the past

after awhile mrs levitt put her arm around the young girl and lifting her to her feet said come dear it is time to go to bed

we left lotus stone and his friend dreaming sweet dreams on the bosom of the lake in due time the next morning they reached minton clement to look after his paper and lotus to drift about for a few weeks in the further enjoyment of his vacation clement settled down to his work all the better for the few days recreation he had taken as we have said in a previous chapter clement entered the office of one of the great dailies in minton soon after he had left school he entered under the ban of a vigorous protest from men and boys as poor and decidedly less prepared for the work in which they were engaged as he for many months his life in that office was one continued day of martyrdom no imposition was too groveling no practical joke too severe to play upon this courageous boy all that littleness of heart could contrive or meanness of soul could execute was placed in the path of this honest lad striving under difficult circumstances to win his daily bread in the teeth of every discouragement he succeeded in gaining the confidence of his employers and in time the good will of those who at first so bitterly opposed him courage of the right kind seldom fails to win its way there are some spirits that no disadvantage can daunt and to whom opposition is worse than useless the errand boy who met the favor of his employer gradually worked himself up to typesetter despite protest after protest from the narrow and biased union the typesetters wit and pleasant manners earned for him a position on the reportorial staff time and diligence finally associated his pungent paragraphs with the editorial page of the paper for years he wrote the comments accredited to the editor being thoroughly acquainted with the newspaper business he determined to setup for himself

he did not leave the office in which he worked however but bought type set up his paper at odd times and had it printed on the dailys press his paper the events was from the beginning a free lance in the newspaper arena he was slave to no party and therefore did not spare the meanness and cupidity of either of them in time his bristling fulminations attracted the attention and criticism of the great daily from whose press his paper was issued the editor of the beforementioned daily objected to the vigorous style of clements paper and advised him to be more conservative but the little paper continued to attack the hateful attitude of the demagogues who ruled in both political parties with the same trenchant force a rupture between clement and the proprietor of the daily necessarily followed the paper dispensed with the services of mr st john and of course their press ceased to send forth his paper for a few weeks mr st john could have been seen carrying his forms from one place to another in constant danger of having an entire edition pied but courage and perseverance won the day clement was at last successful in exciting the interest of a number of friends  in his venture and the result was an electric plant and press of sufficient capacity to answer all the ends of his paper and also to attach a job office to his business the demand for the paper gradually grew those of the race who had first discouraged the enterprise came to its support when their help was no longer absolutely necessary to its success

it is indeed a lamentable fact that the best educated and most able afroamericans find themselves possessed with a rare conservatism when any race enterprise bids for their support it may arise from the belief that anything founded upon a strictly race basis is un american and therefore trends toward isolation the afroamerican press has done and is destined to continue to do great good for the people whose cause it advocates any independent venture however short of our ideals is a manly demonstration of an instinctive wish to rise under the management of clement st john the events was newsy and ably edited it did not bid for distinction by catering to the native jealousy of the race it recognized the common needs of all and manfully fought for them while it did not fondle upon the rich haughty and powerful it also refused to incite against them the distrust of the ignorant and less fortunate while the paper sought to commend the good it did not scruple to attack the evil a friend and believer in christianity the editor despised the shams and ignorant practices which have been interpolated into the church by halfhearted ministers more desirous of a name for themselves than zealous for the purity of the church of god the events castigated pagan marches and spectacular side shows as disastrous to the spiritual growth of christianity the outspoken opinions of the paper made its career for a time one of uncertainty its refusal to fill its columns with uninteresting personals curtailed its popular sales the personal happenings of general interest the events willingly chronicled but printers ink was not wasted in glorifying eveiy dude who boughta street car ticket from one ward of the city to another the opinions of the editor met a varied reception now an afroamerican convention is lauding the editor to a place among the benefactors of mankind now some influential minister is damning every stream of the papers circulation now a grand lodge is making it the spokesman of the order now a coterie of wounded politicians are advocating its suppression in the midst of all these eulogies and animadversions mr st john steadily pursued his course little he recked what direction the cat of public opinion jumped for he knew full well that through all the changes public sentiment might pass the right in the end would prevail his methods savored more of reformation than sensation if he ridiculed some breach of common sense suicidal to party success if he impaled with burning sarcasm some pagan practice in the christian church if he expressed his utter contempt for the course of some political shyster if he disconcerted some social heresy through it all the intelligent reader saw the interest of the reformer rather than the spleen of the egotist the progress of such a paper would necessarily be slow mr st john was not unaware that every step upward must be a measured one

on the whole he preferred the solid march of merit to the windblown inflation that burst after a six weeks voyage the bounds of the events had been carefully set the editor knew that if he lived his paper must live too for worth alone can stand the test of time as the paper broadened in usefulness and deepened in solidity its sunshine friends who bought a copy every fortnight and claimed for that support a half a column to spread airy nothings as uninteresting as silly noticeably fell away the influence of the paper at last began to be felt and its admonitions heeded its editorials had united the race and brought a prejudiced candidate for congress to his senses by first cutting him to death at the polls politicians learned to fear the mad frothings of the events as they had formerly styled clements editorials the paper was not only working out political reforms but assisting the race in other ways in time it added to its job office a book bindery in its columns it welcomed meritorious poems from the rising literati of the race the patent story now and then gave place to some tale written by an afroamerican to do this the paper at first lost money although the story writers and poets gained nothing but publicity by their efforts clement knew that the readers of stories and poems were numbered by the millions these millions hungering for literary food or literary recreation must have their wants supplied could not this hoard of constant readers be at least partially supplied by the men and women of their own race is not a race literature just as necessary as a race church club or school he believed the probability worth acting upon and was therefore willing to give it a trial all of this was within the bounds clement st john had set for the events at work this man of unconquerable determination was thoroughly in earnest but when he left the office and gave himself to his friends he was amiable jovial and companionable he hardly knew lucile malone before the editor of the events was the saucy little stenographers slave nor did he waste time nor words in making her acquainted with the wishes of his heart he saw in lucile what he wanted in a wifeâan actual helpmate lucile was taken aback at his proposal and could hardly believe that this acknowledged prince of wits was sincere in his attentions to a penniless typewriter clement was unceasing in his suit her hesitancy only added fuel to the flame his constancy finally won her consent

the paper on a safe basis clement believed he could afford a wife lucile prevailed upon him however to make her one of the force in his office and thus she would still be able to earn her salary he was in a mood to promise anything if consenting would accelerate the desire of his heart

so in the month of july before the conclave they had decided to be quietly married when the leaves had fallen and the trees were cold and bare

august and september have been numbered with the past since last we saw regenia underwood and mrs levitt sitting on the steps of their home at the elms dreaming over the gilded romance and stern realities of bygone days

the leaves which at that season clothed the oaks and elms in natures royal green had grown sere and yellow and left their former associates in winters rough undress the crisp wind and biting frost of october had stripped bush and tree of their drooping foliage the sweltering sun of sultry dog days followed by the masterful touch of autumns artistic brush had tinted all nature with cardinal and gold and yet the hasty promises sown during conclave week had not ripened into garnered realities not a word had penetrated the seclusion of the elms from the undoubted knight and gallant lotus stone

if he had written regenia had not received the missive it was not likely regenia said to herself day after dav that a letter directed to the elms could have been miscarried to this innocent girl firmly believing the sunshine promises of those she met the silence of mr stone presented a dilemma too complicated for her solution mr stone had obtained her permission to further pursue the agreeable acquaintance formed between them by a friendly correspondence regeriia believed he meant what he said but despite her faith the long expected letter did not come

it did not occur to regenia that his letters might have been intercepted the postman could have informed her differently he could have told her of a polite friend who had on several occasions kindly relieved him of the mail intended for the elms and if she had received no letters dr leighton might account for their disappearance

in truth lotus stone had written more than once since he left mt clare his first duty after his return to washington was to write to the woman to whose unknown keeping he had consigned his heart he waited more than a month but received no answer

he resigned his position in the departmental service and decided to finish the last year of his medical course in one of the great schools of new york before leaving washington however he addressed a second letter to regenia but that receiving the same fate as the first he left for his new field of study a sadder but wiser man for some reason he did not attempt through the medium of clement st john to solve the problem of regenias silence concealing his disappointment beneath the mantle of his pride he entered upon the pursual of his course a more determined if a less happy man he tried to shut regenia out of his thoughts and efface the image of the sweet girl from his memory but the effort was vain he wasted the nights that should have been given to rest and recuperation for the work before him in idly indulging his fancy in the most ridiculous conjectures he would sometimes imagine himself dead and from a martyrs heaven watching regenia as she stood above his cold corpse weeping herself away in the remembrance of her disregard for his devotion again he would congratulate himself that he had succeeded in forgetting her this stage of the case however would rarely last longer than a day whenever books and lectures left his mind to its own resources regenia underwood try as he might to banish her occupied it to the exclusion of every other thought he had arrived at that stage of selfdeception or he at least flattered himself that he had when he believed women as inconstant as the wind what more is she to me than any other butterfly of a days devotion he asked himself frequently and as often answered nothing but the response belied the facts did he grow thin and petulant worrying over the other butterflies that time and again had flitted into his horizon in one resolution however he was persistent he would never write again until she answered the letters already sent nor would he ever manifest his disappointment to clement in this determination however he was not alone regenia had also resolved never to indicate her chagrin to lucile if this lovesick swain and innocent lass hardening their hearts against each other could have peeped into the secret drawer in a certain specialists office in mt clare they would have lost no time in apologizing for a misunderstanding for which neither was to blame

dr frank leighton smiled with fiendish delight as he observed the keen disappointment exhibited by regenia when the postman passed day after day without even so much as a look toward the elms he was not so lost to every trait of the gentleman however as to read the letters he had surreptiously intercepted he often half relented the tendency to meddle with matters which did not concern him but whenever he thought of lotus stone whom he bitterly detested he strengthened his resolve to see to it that regenia never heard a word from him during the latter part of october lucile was to be married and although the affair was to be a very quiet one she had set her heart on having regenia present

mrs levitt and mrs underwood had also been invited for weeks regenia had been looking forward to this event with the greatest interest it was her intention to go a week before the event and remain a week or two after the marriage had been duly solemnized mrs levitt evinced as much interest in the approaching nuptials as regenia she had entered into all of regenias plans with the delight of an actual participant and discussed the coming wedding the gown regenia was to wear the present she intended to take lucile and everything else about it to the young girls unbounded satisfaction a few days before the time fixed for regenia to leave for minton mrs underwood complained of illness as her malady was nothing more alarming than a severe headache the matter elicited but little comment the day that regenia and mrs levitt were to start to minton mrs underwoods symptoms assumed a more threatening aspect it was finally thought best for mrs levitt to remain at home but both mrs underwood and her housekeeper insisted that regenia should go she accordingly set off dr leighton kindly consenting to see her aboard the boat regenia was inclined at first to regret that she had not decided to remain at home although she so much wished to see her friends married after hearing dr leightons opinion that mrs underwoods sickness was nothing more than a passing ailment consequent upon old age she was contented to make the journey to minton

he adroitly directed the conversation from the illness of his aunt to mrs levitt and casually observed your foster mother has known you from childhood i suppose she seems nearer to you than my aunt

she is the very soul of kindness replied regenia i hardly know what would become of me if i did not have mrs levitts oversight

she knew both your mother and father said dr leighton did she know them when your mother first made that wild goose chase to canada he asked

do not say that answered regenia what my mother did is sacred to me

oh certainly said the doctor seeing he was setting a match to powder she acted up to her ideas and who of us do more he added

mrs levitt was present when my parents were married and it was in her house that the wedding dinner was served you ought to hear her tell about it she related to me the entire story the night lucile left for minton

i expect she surrounds it with a romantic halo not justified by the facts the doctor disparagingly answered

oh no she was there and you know poor mother died in mrs levitts arms said regenia sadly

she did was what dr leighton said he thought however mrs levitt knows more than is safe for her or good for me

here we are he remarked after a long silence we are at the landing he alighted and assisting regenia from the phaeton saw her safe aboard the boat

the next morning regenia was met at minton by her friends and whisked away to luciles boarding house during the days that followed the girls were busily concerned with preparations for the momentous event lucile wondered why regenia never spoke of lotus stone regenia wondered if mr stone would be present at the marriage of her friend to regenia the suspense was unendurable and at last she broke the silence the day of the wedding but one she said to lucile have you told me of everyone you expect tomorrow

yes she answered mr stone could not come we are just as cut up at the thought of his absence as you are added the impetuous girl

are you as sure that he will not be here as you seem to be confident that i am expecting him asked regenia laughingly

of course you know he will not be present what was i thinking about anyway but if he treats you as coldly as he does us emphasizing the us you are not too well informed of the eccentricities of mr lotus stone

it is not necessary that he should treat me at all i have never received a line from him is he still in washington asked regenia blushing at this confession

well do you tell me he has never written to you said lucile rising in her excitement what is the matter with that man he seems to have forsaken all of his friends

mr st john declares that something has come over lotus beyond his ability to comprehend you ought to have seen the stiff letter of regrets he sent in answer to our invitation we thought you were the cause of his strange actions but as you are as innocent of any knowledge of his malady as we are i am at a loss to think what the matter is

do not think at all mr stone has perhaps other interests that engage his attentions to the exclusion of marriage and giving in marriage  has he never written to you she asked again ignoring regenias admonition i can not believe it he has written and the big fish of your dream has snapped up the precious missive he has written more than once i am sure but failing of an answer he has coiled himself up within himself and gone into a state of hibernation he is not in washington but in new york concluding his studies this information lucile in her haste to deliver fairly threw at regenias head

i know nothing of mr stone since i last saw him at mt clare and if he has ever written to me i have not received the letter who would be sufficiently interested in mr stone to intercept his letters to me asked regenia excitedly

only one person on earth answered lucile slowly dr frank leighton

i cannot believe that dr leighton however much he may dislike mr stone would stoop to such a scurvy trick what motive could induce a man of his respectability to commit such a palpable crime asked regenia doubtingly

the same motive that induced the big fish to snap up the minnows because he could and because he wanted to do so replied lucile a little hurt at regenias lack of belief in her theory no argument that lucile might offer could have convinced regenia that dr leighton whom she had never known to do a mean thing would be guilty of such a crime at this stage of the discussion mr st john made his appearance and the subject was dropped during the rest of the day the girls were too much occupied to revive it

the next evening lucile and clement were made man and wife

at the little stone church in the presence of quite a few of their most intimate friends the episcopal rector read the beautiful ceremony which forever afterward was to make the interests of lucile malone and clement st john one after the marriage a selected few drove to the snug little home clements frugality had provided and discussed a modest supper

at the height of their enjoyment a sharp potential ring called mr st john to the door it was a messenger boy bearing a telegram fof regenia clement with as little ado as possible called the trembling girl into the next room it was from mrs levitt regenias grandmother was dead

that night as the clock struck twelve regenia underwood her head resting on her hand was a silent passenger on the westbound train

all the way from minton to mt clare regenia sat with her head in her hands still wearing the gown in which she had gone to the wedding she had not even divested herself of the flowers which a few hours since were fresh and beautiful but now as wilted and lifeless as her smitten heart dazed by the suddenness of the terrible information she could not realize how sad was her bereavement

the shock had come in such an unexpected moment if i had only known she wailed over and over again it might have been so different

who is ever prepared for death what boots it that we are in the very presence of the dying when death insidiously approaches we are as illy prepared to admit him and as unwilling to part from our loved ones as if he had entered without warning regenia was filled with remorse for leaving home at such a time all forgetful that her departure had been at the earnest request of mrs underwood why was i not sent for sooner why was mrs underwood left to die with no one but mrs levitt or strangers to close her eyes such questions crowded into her mind again and again during the long and tedious ride at last the train reached mt clare and regenia hastened home as she hurried up the gravel walk the very quietness of the place filled her with a nameless dread softly she entered and made her way to the room where all that was mortal of her late benefactress lay the room was empty she silently closed the door and kneeling beside the bier poured out the pent up sorrows which filled her lonely heart time and again she removed the cloth from the face of the departed and covered the placid brow with affectionate kisses how she recalls now her poignant grief the numberless times alas forever past when with more than a mothers tenderness those kind eyes now glazed and sightless had dwelled with loving compassion upon the lonely child of a daughters disobedience how gently yet how wisely had she directed the straying steps of her often wayward little girl back to the path of right

as regenia stood there alone with her dead all the high hopes and resolves of the past seemed to fly away on the sombre wings of her sorrow throwing herself across the body of the dead and vainly wishing that she too might die she burst into a fit of passionate weeping

sob after sob sad and heartrending reached the ears of mrs levitt who tired out from watching sat dozing away the morning hour in an adjoining room she did not need to be told that it was regenia weeping so bitterly in the other room she waited until the girl had spent the first force of her poignant grief and then softly entering the room she lifted the young girl up and led her out from the presence of the dead

assisting regenia upstairs she took her to her own room and sitting down took regenia in her arms just as she had done a thousand times before and stroked her hair and kissed her forehead until wornout nature came to her relief then putting her charge on the bed she knelt beside the sleeping girl and asked gods aid and guidance through the weary years to come mrs levitt had a premonition how often and how sadly in the future regenia would sigh in vain for the return of that kind friend who had been more than a mother to her

regenia was not less surprised than the rest of her many friends at the suddenness of mrs underwoods demise the day she left for minton as we have before noted her grandmother complained of a severe headache for a day or two after regenia left mrs underwood commenced to be annoyed with her eyes she finally concluded to call in dr leighton who for some reason had not been over to the house since the day he drove regenia to the boat the doctor after a few minutes examination of his aunts eyes hurriedly departed he signified his intention however to return in a short time when he came back he brought an ophthalmoscope and carefully reexamined the eyes of his aunt before he put down the instrument mrs levitt observed his hand shake and his face assume a deathly pallor when the examination was concluded he turned to mrs levitt saying do you know where the office of dr sis receiving an affirmative answer he sat down and drawing a prescription pad from his pocket rapidly noted thereon mrs underwoods symptoms tearing off the paper and carefully folding it he gave it to mrs levitt and in tones slightly tremulous said take this to dr s ask him to return it with the medicine he added after a moments reflection

the broken tone in which he spoke in spite of his attempted selfcontrol somewhat alarmed mrs underwood what is it doctor she asked is my condition worse than you expected

oh no he answered lightly now thoroughly master of himself it is only a little stomach trouble i think you will be all right in a day or two

we must go some time continued mrs underwood quietly but if my time is drawing near i should like to be apprised of it for regenias sake

you are good for a great many years yet auntie he said when mrs levitt comes ask her to save the prescription for me i wish to keep it for future reference

dr leighton left that house steeling himself against his conscience he had enacted a deliberate lie well he knew that his aunt was not destined to live three days longer while examining her eyes he had made a discovery that curdled his blood and sent a tremor through every nerve on the optic nerve he had seen signs of a ruptured blood vessel and he knew full well if something was not done immediately to counteract the effect mrs underwood must die from paralysis of the brain

of this he was aware and knowing the awful consequences had deliberately decided to permit the death of his aunt the day after the examination mrs underwood was no better the day following she died dr leighton had lost no time in preparing for the event he did not want regenia to know a fact more than that of which she was already in possession

after mrs underwoods death this specialist of symptoms who had indirectly led up to her demise by indicating a false diagnosis rummaged the library through and through in search of a will or any other papers of value he might secure to aid him in his design in pursual of his intentions he went to mrs levitt and asked her concerning mrs underwoods papers mrs levitt quickly divined the purpose of his quest and unhesitatingly denied any knowledge of mrs underwoods private affairs this she did with perfect truthfulness although she might have told him of several sealed packages confided to her by the deceased the day before her death to be kept in trust for regenia these papers mrs levitt had thoughtfully concealed dr leighton believing that mrs levitt knew more than she was willing to tell resolved to get her out of the way before his purpose was made manifest the day after mrs underwood was buried he again called at the elms and being informed that regenia was in her room sent for mrs levitt after a polite good morning he said my lawyer will probably be over here today to learn what you know of the papers my poor aunt left this he said in order to frighten mrs levitt into some kind of an admission which would assist him to determine his course toward her

your lawyer or anybody else can come but they will never succeed in drawing blood from a turnip

you must know something said the doctor exhibiting a pretended impatience tell me you could live in confidential relations with my aunt all these years and never have heard her intimate in any way what disposition she intended to make of her property

i am not obliged to divulge everything i have heard during the years i have lived here if i were i might tell something not very complimentary to you dr leighton she replied with some heat

i do not care a cent what you have heard concerning me but you know something of my aunts private affairs and i am going to get it out of you cost what it may said the doctor unguardedly

suppose you try it said mrs levitt in a towering rage what  know i know and any trust mrs underwood reposed in me i will be true to if it cost me my life i know what you are after she cried as he stalked angrily out but you will never accomplish it while my head is hot

he did not speakâhe dared not his blood was up shall i be balked in my plans by this old negress no not if i have to kill her to attain my ends he muttered to himself

that night dr leighton went to a low dive which he had often frequented and concocted a plan to rid himself of this old woman whom he had every reason to believe was all that stood between him and the consummation of his designs he surmised that mrs levitt carried mrs underwoods last will and testament about with her but in this he was mistaken if he could get possession of the old woman search her abstract the papers and destroy them he would be master of the wealth of the underwood estate the only way to do this was to kidnap her but he hesitated to run this risk to his credit it might be said that he also disliked to leave regenia without a friend in the world

he had fully resolved to rob her of her property but he excused himself by saying that regenia had no business to be born anyway it would be a just punishment meted to the heir of his cousin who had so far forgotten the pride of her birth as to make such a mesalliance

after a week of cogitation he could find no other way to dispose of mrs levitt but to send her back to her native land as he called canada having once determined upon this plan he had no difficulty in securing dupes to carry out his designs

he knew a drunken lighthouse keeper who lived in an unfrequented place far up among the hills near the light he tended if this man would take care of mrs levitt during her long visit in canada it would be worth a pretty penny to him

he visited the lighthouse keeper and had no trouble in arranging for mrs levitts detention accordingly one cold sunday night in december as mrs levitt was returning from church alone she was hailed by a cabman who asked her some question sufficient to detain her the carriage drove up to the curb the driver alighted and while he engaged mrs levitt in conversation a confederate stealthily appeared from out the darkness and throwing a heavy shawl over her head she was forced into the cab and rapidly driven toward the river they crossed the ferry and pushed on until nearly daylight at last the cab stopped not a word had been said from the time they started until mrs levitt was lifted from the carriage frozen almost stiff they helped her up a hill to a cabin which contained but two rooms into one of which she was ushered the men tied her hands after which a tall gaunt woman came into the room and thoroughly searched her

one of them men says along ahow that if you tell him where them papers is how that hell let you go said the woman

who said that asked mrs levitt warily

tell her she knows well enough who said it cried a wellknown voice

tell him to hunt till he finds them replied mrs levitt

keep her here and you shall be paid every month in advance said the well knownvoice

he went out and slammed the door but shortly mrs levitt heard him return

dont let the woman leave this room he continued and should she ever attempt it shoot her down like a dog

mrs levitt sat down on the bare floor and drawing forth her hymnal and common prayer she opened the prayer book and by the light of the wood fire repeated the forms in which christians have found consolation for centuries

regenia had retired earlier than usual the evening of mrs levitts mysterious disappearance therefore she did not learn of her absence until the next morning at breakfast she had felt some surprise before coming down to her mornings meal that she had not heard the usual rap upon her chamber door and the usual admonition it is time to rise my dear where is mrs levitt she enquired of a servant as she unfolded her napkin and prepared to eat breakfast

in her room i suppose answered the person addressed she has not been downâperhaps she is sick suggested the servant shall i go and see

never mind  i will go myself replied regenia feeling that if anything had gone wrong with mrs levitt the matter required her immediate attention

pushing back her chair she hastened to mrs levitts chamber and after knocking first gently then more imperatively she ventured to open the door not finding mrs levitt she rapidly retraced her steps to the diningroom where she informed the astonished servant of the fruitlessness of her search

were you awake when mrs levitt returned from church she asked excitedly of the servant

i did not hear her come in was the answer i remained up reading an interesting story until long after church was out

i wonder where she could have gone said regenia tears slowly trickling down her cheeks do you suppose anything has happened to her she asked drying her eyes on the napkin

if she was at church perhaps the rector knows something about her i will run over there and find out if she was at church she said rising throwing a shawl around her shoulders and weeping as she went with flying feet she started for the rectory was mrs levitt at church last night she asked the ministers wife as soon as the door was opened to admit the excited girl the rector hearing the question also came to the door

come in and compose yourself he said kindly mrs levitt was in her usual place last night did she not return after services

i do not know but she is not at home this morning and we are at a loss to account for her absence regenia replied with increasing composure

she was certainly in church remarked the rectorss wife for i saw her turn down the street that leads to the elms

mrs levitt was known to be interested in charity work and the rector therefore suggested she may have gone to some sick friends house and the nature of the case detained her during the night

to this remark regenia made no reply but aimlessly rising she prepared to go both the rector and his wife bade the brokenhearted girl to cheer up at the same time assuring her that mrs levitt would return in her own good time with the very best excuse for the scare she had unwittingly given them

from the rectory regenia directed her steps toward seven corners she did not think dr leighton knew anything of mrs levitt but it was perfectly natural that she should appeal to him in the hour of her great misfortune

good morning he cried in his cheery way as regenia entered what has brought my fair cousin out so early this inclement morning he asked then as if having just discovered her swollen eyes and tearstained face why whats the matter you are not ill he exclaimed as she sat down in one of the large office chairs

regenia told him what the reader already knows that dr leighton was well aware of striving as she repeated the story to retain her selfpossession

the doctor listened to her plaintive recital with well feigned surprise and when she had concluded questioned her carefully concerning mrs levitts movements her evening at the church the rectors story and the general habits of her fostermother

when he had ascertained how much was known of mrs levitts movements on the previous evening he sat for some time as if in contemplation of the best method to pursue to find the old lady and restore her to her friends

the rector is probably right he said at last she must be detained somewhere on a pressing mission of mercy

that probability is hardly admissible said regenia thoughtfully it is so unlike mrs levitt if she were going to be absent all night she would have come home first to tell me however urgent the call she knows too well what a fright her failure to return from church would occasion

now that my poor aunt is no more said dr leighton it may be that mrs levitt feels that she is not obliged to give such a strict account of her doings the most trusted servants grow careless when the pressure from the parlor is removed

mrs levitt was never a servant in our house spiritedly objected regenia she has never been obliged to give any account of her movements

if she was not a servant what was she asked the doctor unable tp hide his annoyance i confess my inability to understand your fine distinctions she lived with you and assisted in the direction of the affairs of the house if she was not my aunts equal she must have been an inferior in other words a servant i mean no discredit to the old woman he said in an apologizing way as regenia arose to leave

i do not know what you consider her but she has been everything to meâmother companion and friend and on these terms she shall remain replied regenia

if we are able to find her said the doctor laughingly he bade her as she left the office to try and compose herself if anything can be done to find mrs levitt you may depend upon me to do it he promised to advertise in the evening paper offering a reward for any information concerning mrs levitt and to forthwith put detectives to work on the case providing they suspected foul play

with laggard steps and heavy heart regenia returned home from her bootless search for the first time during her short life she realized what it is to be alone in the world all that day she watched in vain for mrs levitts return every footfall that reached her ears she hoped marked the coming of her dear old friend the day slowly wore away and night came but brought no news to regenia of the much desired object of her solicitation dr leighton came over early in the evening only to inquire if the lost had been heard from the rectors wife also came over to cheer the young girl and strive to revive her drooping spirits

so the first night came and went and the next day and the next week until poor regenia despairing gave up all hope of ever again seeing her friend with a grief that could not be consoled she passed her days in waiting her nights in weeping from a bright happy girl in a few weeks she had grown prematurely settled she looked years older than she did the day we first saw her standing on the steps of the elms saucily allaying the thirst of clement st john and lotus stone

one morning about two weeks after the search for mrs levitt commenced dr leighton called regenias heart beat high with swelling hope as she saw him enter the gate a glance at his face assured her that he came on no unimportant mission she was certain he brought news of mrs levitts whereabouts

you have heard something from mrs levitt

she said as the doctor followed her into the library

i am sorry to say that i have not replied the doctor making no attempt to dissemble his annoyance that the girl seemed to think of nothing but her old nurse i am here on business of quite a different nature

regenias interest immediately subsided if he knows nothing of mrs levitt she thought anything else he has to say is of no consequence

you do not ask the purport of my business he said piqued at the awkward silence which followed his first affirmation

i am waiting she said spiritlessly

did it ever occur to you that at sometime mrs underwoods business would have to be settled up and her last intentions concerning the distribution of her estates ascertained he asked sharply

i never gave the matter a moments consideration grandmother had no child but mother she continued lowering her voice and my mother none but me i naturally supposedâshe hesitatingly addedâthere was no one else to inherit what she left

very true from your standpoint and if things could be adjusted in that simple direct way writing wills would be a waste of energy replied the doctor with a forced laugh which made regenia shudder and wish for mrs levitt

mrs levitt knew more of grandmothers wishes than anyone else if she were only here sighed the puzzled girl

mrs levitt can not be found it seems but in her absence we may be able to find something more important where did my aunt keep her papers he said at the same time rising and approaching a secretary in another part of the room

i do not know but she often wrote at that desk timidly replied regenia

dr leighton opened the writing desk and taking out the key proceeded to unlock and examine the contents of drawer after drawer he at last drew forth a package yellow with age and untying it took out a paper which after looking over it a few moments appeared to greatly agitate him

what is it said regenia have you found the will

this seems to be it said the doctor slowly but there seems to be some mistake look at it

regenia took up the document and had read but a short time before she dropped it with the exclamation why this gives everything to you poor grandmother how could she have felt so bitterly against me

it was the expressed wish of judge underwood she says here and in keeping with a promise extracted from her by him on the day he died said dr leighton

the severity of the conditions of the will did not dawn upon regenia until dr leighton said you need have no fears i will always look after you the will enjoins as nothing could be left you directly that i provide an allowance which is to be yours exclusively as long as you live

mrs underwood had a right to leave my mothers portion to whoever she listed but placing me on your bounty dr leighton is beyond her power if i am to be disinherited i will not accept the verdict with recommendations to mercy

i willingly assume the responsibility he said approaching and essaying to stroke her hair

i am not a child she said and need nocajoling i thank you very much for your generosity but i do not feel that i can accept anything from you on the terms set forth in that will

you are entirely wrong my dear said the doctor attempting to take her hand i want to be a friend to you is it my fault that your mother made a wretched mistake

not another word said regenia whatever my mother did her child willingly accepts as right

but my dear regenia you must let me explain he said throwing himself between the irate girl and the door through which she attempted to escape

explanations are unnecessary she said waving him away i fear doctor you will end by adding insult to injury

dont be a fool said he losing his temper do you persist in your refusal of my offer

i do she replied he stood aside and she passed through the door and with measured steps made her way upstairs

dr leighton smiled as she left thinking how easily his scheme had worked there was a degree of dissatisfaction however in the girls refusal to accept the offered allowance ill bring her around he thought as he helped himself into his overcoat and prepared to leave the house

now to have the will probated and i take possessionânine points in law he chuckled

regenia went to her room no longer a girl this last stroke of sorrow had made the girl a woman to question the genuineness of the will dr leighton had produced never occurred to her if an expert had examined it he could have told her that its aged look was the work of a clever villain that deft hands had forged the signature and that the very paper was placed in that drawer not a week previous to the day it was found she had not been in her room five minutes before she had decided upon her course brushing away her tears she began packing her trunk if the property were dr leightons she had no right to remain there another day she must go away but where i will go to lucile she said half aloud

she had a little money she counted it over and found it was enough to pay her fare to minton and a few dollars besides

when this is gone what then she thought god will take care of me she said devoutly

having packed her trunk she put on her wraps and prepared to leave an hour to train time said she consulting her watch before she left she went into mrs levitts room and kneeling there asked gods guidance and that the patient loving disposition of mrs levitt might fall upon her and then with streaming eyes she left the house

she ordered her trunks sent to the depot and in less than two hours after dr leighton left her she was flying toward minton

the train on which regenis underwood was a passenger had left in the distance many a mile post before the excitement under which she labored had sufficiently subsided to permit her to take a sober inventory of the events which had transpired in the past few hours she did not question the wisdom of leaving the elms so hastily this she had determined to do be the action wise or foolish she would not eat the crumbs of charity that fell from the table of drleighton her womans intuition told her that all was not right she did not suspect the forgery that had been so cleverly sprung by dr leighton but she suspected his intentions toward her and rightly decided that her greatest safety lay in instant flight

as the cars sped along her anxiety increased she sat idly looking out of the coach window counting the miles she must yet travel before reaching the end of her journey and after the stop at each station consulting her traveling guide and timing the distance to the next stop it seemed to regenia that the space between mt clare and minton had lengthened since last she passed that way the car was crowded hot and poorly ventilated she tried to while away the time by trying to surmise where so many people were going what their mission and who awaited their coming would sorrow or happiness crown the end of their journeys some of them perhaps are going home she mused home she said to herself and for the first time in her life she realized what it is to be without a home alas she had no place she now could call her home no homeâhow the sad admission echoed through her young heart perhaps everyone in this coach has a home but me she thought i have neither home nor friends dropping her young head into her hands she began to picture to herself the miseries of a friendless homeless life how little she had ever thought of this before she realizes now how cold and perfunctory had been her sympathy for others similarly situated

after what seemed to regenia an unending journey she welcomed the brakemans nasal cry minton as the crowded surface car wended its way from the depot regenia noticed that nearly every passenger carried a package it slowly dawned upon her that it was christmas eveâchristmas for all the world she thought but how sad indeed it will be for me

regenia was tired and thoroughly unhappy before the creeping car stopped at the corner of the street a few doors from her friends house she almost ran in her impatience to reach the door she rushed up the steps of the house she had left but a few weeks before and rang the bell she waited but no answer she rang again and after ages it seemed to her an upstairs shutter was slowly opened and a voice she knew and welcomed called out whos there

it is i said regenia do you not know me

the window went down with a crash and flying feet were heard hastening down the stairs then the door flew wide open and the two friends threw themselves into each others arms

come right in said lucille what a surprise you gave me i knew it was not clement he would have let himself in by his latchkey why did you not write did you want to give us a real surprise

lucile did not expect these questions to be answered but in her happy excitement she seized a womans right to ask all the questions she chose

regenia now that she was safe with lucile could not say a word but with her arms around her friends neck she wept until she was calm enough to tell her story

do not try to speak my poor dear said lucile after a time i do not care if yon wait weeks to tell me all about it stroking the girls hair and now and then affectionately kissing her regenia soon became composed enough to tell her all

we thought as much she indignantly replied when she had heard regenias story clement has been looking for just such a finale i could not believe that dr leighton could be such a doublydyed villain but clement was right about him as he is about most people she replied with pardonable pride you are just right in refusing to touch a cent of his bloodmoney

lucile had scarcely finished her sympathetic remarks before she heard mr st johns key in the door she hastened to meet him and said i have a great surprise for you

maybe you are not alone with your surprises my little woman seeing this is christmas eve hesaid pleasantly

no but i have a real surprise one in human flesh

mr st john surveyed his wife a second time saying now thats a poser 

you mean thing said lucile slapping him fondly

come in here she continued at the same time opening the door

why regenia he said this is a delight indeed that lucile has brought as a christmas gift

regenia hardly had time to respond to his royal welcome before lucile anticipating her related the whole story

why did you not write to us said clement a little hurt by regenias apparent reticence

i could get no reply to my letters and naturally supposed that lucile happy in her new life could not find time to devote to idle correspondence

i did answer your last letter dear and receiving no reply wrote a second time with the same result said lucile

i have never received a line from you since i left your house the night of the wedding replied regenia with astonishment

your mail has been intercepted of this you may be assured said clement hotly i more than suspect that is the reason you have not heard from another quarter

just the very reason dear you have not heard from mr stone poor lotus continued the impetuous lucile he has been eating his heart out with grief i know

in the mind of mrs st john the matter was quite satisfactorily explained

i am inclined to think you have hit the mark this time my little woman said clement amused at his wifes rapid conclusions

of course i am correct am i not always so asked lucile

yes yes certainly you areâand mrs levitt what has become of her inquired clement turning to regenia

mysteriously disappeared she went to church two weeks ago last sunday night and has never returned the doctor advertised and exhausted every means to find her without success said regenia the tears chasing each other down her cheeks dr leighton thinks she will be found though she added through her tears

he does said clement with a sneer i wonder if he does doctor seems to be a very hopeful man did mrs levitt know anything about mrs underwoods affairs

on receiving an affirmative reply he continued she will never turn up if dr leighton can prevent it

for awhile the big awkward fellow sat looking into the fire thinkingâthinking of the past summer and the transient nature of everything in this world

his face took on a blacker look his form assumed a more rigid tension and gazing at regenia sitting there so frail and sad he said in happier days my little friend i promised perhaps thoughtlessly to be your knight you took my card and very wisely call at my home for a redemption of former pledges what i said then in playful pastime i repeat now in terrible earnest you know how welcome you are here with lucile just as welcome as if you were her sister you have been wronged the cause of the wronged innocent is my cause lucile is your sister i am your friend well make common warfare mrs levitt will be found and for every sorrow that whitelivered villain has caused you and her to suffer he shall suffer doubly

the two girls sat looking at clement and each seem to see the rough hard face lose itself in the beautiful heroic man who sat before them the personification of every holy virtue

lucile stole softly behind his chair and with her arms around his neck and her glowing cheek against his gnarled face silently thanked god that heaven had sent her such a man regenia rose also and taking his hand knelt beside him covering the unshapely member with kisses over this blissful scene the angels that surprised the lowly shepherds so many years before were chanting in seraphic harmony peace on earth good will to men

regenia first found her voice and in broken words stammered her thanks to mr st john

i never thought of asking you to take up my cause i did not come because i wanted you to trouble about me but there was no one else to go to i am alone and moneyless

there there not another word of course you would come to your lucile i should never have quite forgiven you if you had not let me take your things up to your room come with me she said slipping her arm around regenias waist in her old girllike way are you going to hang up your stocking i am she continued without awaiting a reply

lucile was not long in making regenia feel at home clement sat by the fire musing for sometime then hearing regenias cheery laugh vibrate through the hall and musically ring in his ears he arose with a complaisant smile on his earnest face and noiselessly stole into the street to make his stock of christmas presents meet the demands of his recently increased family

when he returned the house was dark but by the flickering glare of the dying embers he discovered on each side of the mantel limp and black the sisters stockings with a happiness akin to bliss for the first time in his life he played the part which santa claus is believed by all good children to fill so delightfully this being done he silently crept off to bed it was late the next morning when he awoke as he lay there turning over in his mind the events of the evening before the voice of his wife ringing out a merry christmas was heard without the door

when he descended to the sitting room he found the two girls bubbling over with joy each had received or pretended to have received the very thing that she most desired clement did not go to the office that day a holiday edition of the events having been sent to its destination the day previous he thought that he could well afford to make the day a happy one for his wife and her unexpected visitor no references to the sorrows of yesterday were allowed to intrude themselves upon the unalloyed pleasures of the day the consummate skill with which lucile filled the duties of hostess kept regenias mind too much occupied to prey upon itself what with a matinee in the afternoon dinner at six and a round of pleasant levees and receptions at night excepting the nameless void too deep for utterance which filled regenias heart she almost forgot her unhappiness

the day passed all too soon as happy days will pass and sunday following she had time to brood over her misfortunes she found it no easy thing to determine what course to pursue in her sad distress upon one thing she had early resolved she would not sit in idleness an expense to her kind friends a misery to herself she would work if work could be found during the afternoon she ventured to indicate to mr st john her wish to find something to do as soon as possible he counseled patience and promised in the mean time to keep a sharp lookout for a position

try to content yourself here with lucile he said kindly

i could live with her forever she hastened to reply but now that i shall be obliged to look out for myself the sooner i face the stem truth by actual experience the better

what would you like to do i understand he continued interpreting her look but while we are at it we might as well try to find something congenial if that is not possible why then we can try for the next best and so on down to the end of the list he said laughingly

now you are laughing at me said regenia a little discomfited

oh no indeed not at you but rather at my own thoughts i was thinking as i spoke how far down we should go before you cried hold enough i was wondering if at the end of the list we found a laundry how long it would take you to rub out both patience and muscle

i have determined to do any kind of house work rather than eat the bread of idleness of course i have my preference but no choice she added with a sigh of resignation

how would you like to teach

better than anything else you may put that at the head of the list i love the little folks so dearly that i cried when my six weeks in the school of practice were ended she said eagerly

he did not reply to her enthusiastic expression of preference but arose and hastily left the room he shortly returned bearing in his hand an open letter which he silently passed to regenia

write that i will accept the position she said rising excitedly

you are not going now are you he asked with a smile at least you will say goodbye to lucile he continued his smile now spreading into a broad grin

she either did not hear or ignored his question sitting down as if forgetful of where she was she asked earnestly how far is it to grandville

too far to walk tonight had you not better wait and take an early breakfast and a fresh start tomorrow morning said clement

oh mr st john do not trifle with me i am so much in earnest

so i observe he replied

what is the matter said lucile coming in just as her husband was finishing his observations

nothing only i have just informed this young lady of a school away down in dixie and she wants to start off walking before supper replied mr st john with a merry laugh

well he knew what heart drippings awaited this enthusiastic young woman in her eagerness to rush into an unknown world his jolly laughter was only the cloak that disguised the pity which filled his big loving heart

of all things said lucile teaching is the last which i should wish to try why do you want to go down into that heathen country it is bad enough for a man let alone a little frail mite like you she said slipping her arm around regenias slender waist you stay here with me i was just thinking a moment ago clement it would be nice to teach regenia stenography

i would rather teach regenia replied i believe it is my work i have determined to accept this place and try it anyway if i do not like it i will come back next summer and learn stenography

so it was decided that regenia would go south and take up the ferule and the pointer mr st john wrote immediately to the trustees of grandville that he had secured a teacher and on new years night after much good advice and as many precautions as if regenia were going among the cannibals in the south sea islands mr st john and lucile kissed her goodbye and bade her godspeed

it was with feelings of fear bordering on despair that regenia underwood alighted from the coach the second morning after leaving minton she had pierced through to the very heart of the south an absolute stranger armed with a letter to rev mr foggs she set out carrying her traveling bag on a hunt for this much desired person it was through this gentleman of some importance in the community where he lived that clement had obtained the position that regenia so readily accepted after some inquiry of the hangerson always about the station she secured a hack and was driven to the parsonage the parson was at breakfast and regenia was received by his good wife who with true southern hospitality invited the young girl out to breakfast

regenia wanted no second invitation her scanty lunchbox had been turned bottom side upward and thrown from the car window long before the sun had closed his burning eye the evening before

she was tired hungry and sleepy a trio of discomforts which when added to loneliness made a combination hard to outweigh in the scale of misfortunes while regenia is enjoying her much needed refreshment let us take a little glimpse at the place in which she is to meet humanity in every form for the next few months

on a little knoll in the centre of a clump of trees near the outskirts of the city of grandville stands a neat white building the school house has been recently erected the knoll on which it stands slopes gently for some distance until it reaches the banks of a babbling brook whose clear waters laugh and frisk over its shallow bed a rustic footlog hewed smooth on one side and made safe for passengers by a rude guard consisting of a hickory pole placed between the forks of two uprights nailed to the abovementioned log formed the approach to the school the building had desk room and seating capacity for sixty but was expected to accommodate more than twice that number the school was new because the necessity for it was new also a northern syndicate had recently established in the vicinity of the school a large steel plant the workmen about this new enterprise were for the most part afroamericans the company with farseeing generosity had almost immediately erected two churches and a school house well aware that around these institutions so highly prized by the negro could be best made permanent a happy and contented class of laborers

the afroamerican unlike any other people similarly circumstanced believes in god and intelligence toward these two ideas he inclines with unerring instinct he may be irreligious he may be ignorant but with all the strength of an overenthusiastic heart he believes in the church and the school the shrewd yankees knew this and planned their campaign of cheap labor with gilded generosity accordingly it was the generosity that pays the religion that brings shekels with its contentment the children of the laborers at this new plant were to be the recipients of the syndicates generosity regenia underwood thenceforward would share with them their sorrows and misfortunes and through them hear more acutely the heartthrobs of this sinburdened world than she would have heard in a century at mt clare

as regenia entered the dining room rev foggs pushed his chair back from the table and walking around a number of little foggs made his way to regenia and grasping her hand with a warmth too genial for comfort welcomed her to such hospitality as his table afforded

make yourself at home he said reseating himself and tucking his napkin under his chin you must be hungry after your long ride how far have you come i received mr st johns telegram yesterday but supposed you would not arrive until this afternoon how did you find me anyway he continued not even deigning to await a reply to all of these questions when he was at last satisfied that he had asked about all the questions he could think of he paused for a reply

regenia answered his series of questions in a general way which seemed to satisfy him until he could get time to cut another huge rasher of ham and fill his plate sufficiently to begin a new siege of stuffing and talking

the breakfast being over mr foggs busied himself getting regenias things together preparatory to escorting her to her boarding place

you will find mrrs landers a most excellent woman he said after regenia had thanked the parsons wife for her kindness bade the group of little foggs goodbye and started off with her new found clerical friend

to this information regenia very discreetly made no reply

i have known her for years continued her escort and she has always been a consistent christian she is one of the leading members of my church and stands very high socially he volunteered as soon as she heard you were coming she sent over to tell me that she would take vou he continued

he might have said if he had been nice about little truthful expressions that he was at sister landers very hospitable home when clement st johns telegram reached him in fact if the truth must be told when rev mr foggs was not at home it was safe to predict that he could be found at the house of this most excellent woman mrs landers kept a very excellent kind of brandy and soda a decoction for which it is painful to relate rev mr foggs had a decided partiality

does mrs landers live near the school regenia finally ventured to ask

no not very near but near enough to give you a good appetite after the walk said mr foggs eyeing his companion narrowly

mrs landers lives in the city he continued but your school is out in the suburbs in the vicinity of the steel plant it is a little walk from here he said as he rang the door bell of a large sombre brick building but after you become accustomed to the journey you will rather enjoy it than otherwise

as he finished the last sentence the door was partially opened and a pair of lynxlike black eyes peeped out at the two visitors it was thrown wide open when elder foggs bland voice cried out good mornin sister landers this is miss underwood

mrs landers came forward took both of regenias hands into her big brown palms and said welcome to grandville miss underwood

the woman that regenia saw standing before her was a thin wiry individual neither black nor brown but a soft shading off between the two a color not unknown among afroamericans raven black hair little sparkling watery black eyes and an obsequious overweening manner that was intended to inspire confidence but had exactly the opposite effect upon our young heroine

mrs landers bade her visitors to be seated and after indulging in the ordinary commonplace thought necessary on such occasions she showed regenia to her room the poor child was glad at last to be alone she lost no time in lowering the blinds and throwing her tired form across the bed where she slept until called to dinner

mr foggs threw himself upon one of the large sofas in the room and with the contentment of one who is perfectly at home availed himself of the prerogative of his cloth to enjoy a teteatete with mrs landers

it is as well to mention at this juncture that the rev ananias foggs was a powerful man in grandville his name was a tower of strength among the members of his faith and order in appearance he was rather striking dressed always in full clerical attire his vest buttoned to the throat a white cravat that reminded you that perhaps there had been a time when it was immaculate but that time was in the grim and dizzy long ago a shining black hat sleek in spots looking for all the world as if it had been treated with beeswax and tallow black trowsers ornamented with tobacco juice and bulging slightly at the knees rattling grey and white celluloid cuffs and collar smoothly shaven saddle colored face large gray eyes of medium height inclined to stoutness and a selfconscious selfimportant air wall give an excellent mental photograph of rev ananias foggs he always carried a book in his hand in order as he himself expressed it that i may seem deep

rev mr foggs was a very friendly man in fact his friendliness was so fullsome especially after a prolonged stay at that most excellent womans mrs landers as to be tiresome he was of course an educated manâeducated from above downward he had begun his intellectual structure at the cupola he had commenced the study of theology when the third reader was a mazy dilemma he was said to be an erudite greek and hebrew scholar but judging from his pronunciation english was to him a foreign language he had a head full of other mens ideas indiscriminately mixed he was an adept in the theories and disputes of augustine and thomas aquinas but in the vast sea of independent generalization he was without a helm rudder or sail his sermons were a combination of bluff bluster and crocodile enthusiasm and he had reached the highest pinnacle of pulpit oratory when he had hypnotized his hearers into a wild orgy of muscular gyrationsâmotion rather than emotion a conscious hypocrite he misled rather than directed the native devotiveness of an ignorant people no sermon was complete that did not end in a shout and to this end he regularly wound up his noisy diatribe with a pathetic description of the dead or dying which as he expressed it to those in his confidence was sho to fetch em

with all of these defects the character of rev foggs was not without its redeeming qualities he was generous and hospitable to a fault no traveling brother in straightened circumstances ever left his home hungry or wanted a bed to rest for the night who could not find it for the asking at the open door of the humble parsonage no night was so dark that he could not find his way to the rude homes of the sick and dying he had a weakness for preaching funerals his obituary efforts were noted for miles around judging other mens frailties by a knowledge of his own he found it easy to throw over their indiscretions the mantle of charity and stretch to the point of breaking his rigorous creed if need be to assure their friends that the dead had passed the grim portal in perfect safety

it has been previously stated that he was a regular caller at the boarding house or lodging house of mrs landers mrs landers as far as anybody knew grew up with the town of grandville she had owned that large brick house and lived just as she was living the day regenia entered her door for so many years that the community had ceasd to conjecture about her age and solved the tireless enigma by considering her a fixture she did not look a day older than she had looked twentyfive years before her hair was as black her step as light and her ability to get on in the world as pronounced as it had been at anytime during all the years the community had known her she was wonderfully fond of pretty young girls and never seemed to be so thoroughly happy as when surrounded by them in her home there were those who nodded their heads and smiled knowingly when mrs landers name was mentioned some even doubted her loud amens and moments of entranced happiness during sunday services but by regular contributions and a whispered suspicion that she carried under her black bonnet a knowledge of the frailties and mishaps of many of the leaders of the congregation for a quarter of a century enabled her in spite of her enemies to hold her state unchallenged in church and society

mrs landers enjoyed the friendship of many of the oldest white families of the city what tie bound them was not disclosed but it is certain that some of them seem to come and go night and day from her door what their mission was is not known but no one seemed to question their propriety into such a home and among such people goes regenia underwood to make her maiden effort at bread winning

when mrs landers came down from regenias chamber she invited rev foggs into the dining room where she set out a bottle filled with brandy some sugar and water and bade him enjoy himself while she busied herself with her mornings work the elder sat by the blazing fire alternately snoozing and in his moments of wakefulness mixing with the deftness of a veteran his favorite drink

after awhile he went out into the kitchen making himself at home as he called it and kept the widow company until dinner he was very talkative during the meal and once or twice the shrewd mrs landers felt it her duty to interpose to keep regenia from seeing in rev foggs rambling hilarious conversation something that might prejudice the young girl against him

the dinner was at last ended to the infinite relief of both regenia and mrs landers regenia was tired and longed for quiet and rest mrs landers had the good sense to see that every moment the possibility of elder foggs making a fool of himself was measurably increasing

after many promises to call around the next day and escort the new teacher to school and introduce her to the pupils regenia was permitted to slip away to her room and think over the incidents of the past few days and plans for the morrow the shades of evening had fallen around the dimly lighted streets before elder foggs his steps still unsteady made his way back to the parsonage

too much praise cannot be awarded the bravehearted girls who leave without a murmur their pleasant homes and agreeable companions and in answer to the call of duty or necessity go forth alone into an untried world to take up the burdens and responsibilities of life friends at home never know what they suffer if one real chapter from their lives with all of its sorrows temptations and unmentioned privations could find its way to the happy firesides they have left it would fill the doting parents hearts with sadness regenia underwood had few to regret her mishaps or condole her sorrows she was alone in the world and a world too in which she was in many respects a stranger reared in an atmosphere of ease and refinement she was illy prepared for the uncouth side of life she was so soon to enter she was of course well educated without a thought of ever having any practical use for her education she had finished the high and normal school courses in the city of mt clare she never dreamed when spending her six weeks in the school of practice that stern necessity would some day demand an application of the knowledge attained as she sat by the flickering wood fire on the first night of her stay at mrs landers she ransacked her brain to recall any little scrap of theory concerning the first day in a new school

she had heard with indifference if not with actual impatience in vain she wished for some of her old notebooks packed away in some dark closet at mt clare perhaps to be remembered but never again to play any part in the real work of life at last by dint of hard constant thinking she managed to recall a few facts which would serve as a beginning contenting herself with her partial preparation and relying on circumstances for future developments she went to bed to dream of schools of fretful children stern trustees and duties but indifferently performed till the loud rapping of mrs landers the following morning awakened her to meet her fate

her breakfast was not more than half finished when the door bell rang and the cheery voice and loud laugh of mr foggs was heard in the front parlor true to his promise he was on hand to escort the new teacher to her school to regenia mr foggs with all his kindness had grown to be a somebody that she must tolerate but could not esteem his want of modesty his coarse unintentional familiarity filled her with a nameless dread his exhibition of himself the evening before concealed as it was by mrs landers had not escaped her sharp eyes she was unaware it is true of the cause that had so transformed the man who had assumed a virtue if he had it not on the morning she first met him but it was evident to her inexperienced eyes that mr foggs was no better than he should be considering the sacred office that he filled she had therefore resolved to pursue his friendship no further than necessity compelled

when she came down to the parlor prepared for school she found mr foggs impatiently awaiting her he was conscious that his behavior the evening before was not of a nature to increase the new teachers good opinion of him and therefore he attempted to repair the supposed injury that his dignity had suffered by a liberal dose of politeness

ah good morning he said advancing to meet her and rubbing his hands expressive of his delight i hope you rested well and that you are in prime condition to wield the rod he said taking regenias hand and giving it another of those viselike contractions that almost made her scream with pain

i am very well she said wincing with pain and extracting the ring that had buried itself in her tender flesh during the bear grasp that mr foggs called handshaking

it is a beautiful day he said as he opened the door one of those rare winter days that you never see in your climate

and it was a beautiful day the warm rays of the southern sun fairly penetrated regenias heart as she walked along as she listened to the incessant flow of mr foggs wagging tongue she felt for such a day in january she could really feel happy even in the company of mr foggs

you have never been south miss regenia he queried as they walked along

never before replied regenia

then you have missed half of your life you will find us a broadhearted kindly disposed people entirely different from what we are represented to be entirely different he added repeating himself without apparent satisfaction

i should be very much surprised to find you other than kind hospitality is considered one of the cardinal virtues of southerners regenia ventured to say

your school is over there said mr foggs pointing toward the knoll where regenia could see a white building nestling among a clump of trees

how beautiful she exclaimed it is not so far after all she thought so busy had been her own thoughts that she had not observed the distance passed over

there are the children she said as she saw a number of little girls bolder and less patient than the others running down the hill and across the footlog to be the first to meet her they stopped half afraid to come forward and greet her

regenias womans instinct immediately mastered the situation she called out a pleasant good morning and taking each of them by the hand she thanked them for being so thoughtful as to bring their greetings the children answered never a word but walked back to the school the fortunate ones holding her hands while the others with wideeyed admiration followed along behind

a strange procession they made the rotund smoothfaced mr foggs the slender refined girl dressed in deep mourning and the accompaniment of girls of every color age and size as they reached the school others came forward boys and girls some leading their little brothers or sisters who hung back in awe of the new teacher as they entered the school regenia was surprised to find every desk appropriated and the children sitting there as orderly as if the master had just stepped out leaving them on their honor long before time to ring for the opening hour she divined the cause of their phenomenal behavior there were more pupils than desk room almost two for one and happy indeed was the pupil who by dint of early rising had got there in time to seize and hold a desk the less fortunate ones stood around the walls or seated themselves on the platform at the teachers feet when the bell tapped for order those that could not find seats crowded into the seats already occupied to the discomfort not to say disgust of the first possessors regenia did not know what to do she gave her own chair to a disappointed little one who had had a seat in the beginning but had been hustled out by some of the more aggressive she cast her eyes at the chair held down by mr foggs and inwardly measured the time that would have to elapse before she could give that to some of the children

as she read the twentythird psalm and looked out on the motley crowd of waiting children she never before felt how precious were those simple words the lord is my shepherd asking the children to rise she bade them repeat after her the lords prayer solemn as the moment was to regenia she could not help noting that hand in hand go the sublime and the ridiculous some of the children in rising for prayers kept one hand on the seat they had vacated in constant fear that some less devoted pupil would steal into it during the solemn moment others kneltâknelt on their seats and even then opened their eyes occasionally to make certain that they still held their own

after the opening mr foggs blew his horn and while he plastered regenia with florid compliments he did not fail to make plain the fact that she was there through the energy and forethought of rev mr foggs

having finished his remarks principally complimentary to himself he left after offering to call that evening and see that miss regenia found her way back home an offer which miss regenia modestly but firmly declined the exit of mr foggs was a relief in more ways than one in the first place regenia was anxious to secure his chair to seat a brighteyed little boy who had been crowded off the platform and was sitting with his bow legs doubled up under him on the floor the very picture of forlorn disappointment in the second place she was growing rather restless under the continual stare of so many pairs of eyes and wanted to begin work but was not desirous of any company more critical than the children

what to do first she scarcely knew it was evident that so many things were necessary that she hesitated where to begin finally as a sort of compromise between discordant intentions she asked those who could read to come forward accordingly about half of the school rose as one man and made a rush for place in front of the platform there was crowding and pushing and tears and angry looks among the children that came forward while those that were seated on the platform at the teachers feet mostly small children rolled themselves up like a spring curtain to save their toes from being trampled regenia smiled at the picture she found on examination that there were almost as many grades and as many different kinds of readers as there were children she separated them as best she could putting them in temporary classes according to size and then after seating part of them finally succeeded in bringing a kind of order out of the chaos

the children were eager to learn for the most part kind and obedient and in many a rough exterior the teacher was not long in ascertaining that an angel slumbered books were the greatest hindrance to progress whole families had come to school carrying by turns one book the sole possession of four or five the one book was expected to serve them all irregardless of gradation one little boy a stranger to the intricacies of the alphabet brought a dogeared edition of the old testament who gave it to him or what he was expected to do with such a book was not apparent but that he prized it highly was evident from the great care he took in keeping it constantly near at hand no rollicksome game on the play ground could induce him to surrender for a moment the guardianship of that bookâa lesson from which older and wiser heads might profit

the first day had not ended before regenia discovered that the poetry of the situation was every moment growing more prosaic she saw before her nearly one hundred of raw natures children children coming from all kinds of environment children whose little hearts perchance were to be for the first time thrilled by a gentle word children that were unlovable because they had never been loved into their crude existence she was for the first time to send a loving influence that would change their ideals soften and subdue their hard lots aye prove the very savior of life unto life to many of them

it was with a heavy heart that regenia closed her school that day and slowly took her way down the hill across the footlog and set her face resolutely toward home she indeed wondered if from these sadeyed boys and girls trudging along at her heels she would ever be able to accomplish any lasting good comparing her school with the well ordered schools of her childhood she had her serious doubts she could not see for the future is veiled that forth from those surroundings would issue an influence whose power for good would water the barren places of time and tell in eternity she little thought that sitting at her feet that day were boys whose noble lives would tell on the future that from the lofty pinnacle to which some of those very children would rise they would tell of her influence and bless and glory in the fact that she was born

she stopped a moment in her reverie and turning her thoughts from the school and its future looked down the valley toward which the little stream was making its way toward the black smoke of the steel plant flanking it on all sides stood row after row of shacks as they are called âonestory frame houses stripped on the outside unplastered and forming a refinement of the old quarters famous in slavery days here lived the parents of the children she was to teach the houses for the most part contain two rooms and a loft where the children by the help of a ladder climbed to sleep some of these houses were occupied by two families and not infrequently contained a boarder or two besides the workmen came from every part of the state where colored men had opportunity to engage in skilled labor it is useless to say that such environments and such a place especially in its formative period is a very hot bed of ignorance and vice hardly a night passed that forth from the low dives that were everywhere prevalent some human being was not ushered shot or cut to death whisky never more certainly performed the work of its fell master the devil than among these hard working negroes on the outskirts of grandville

before she had been many weeks a teacher the children insisted that regenia accompany them to their homes and meet their parents a proposal she readily accepted she soon learned to move in and out among the rough crowds that stood about the doors of the shacks with as much confidence that she would be kindly received as if she had been at her own home it was noticeable how the loud talk was subdued and with what politeness the greatest swaggering bully about the furnace lifted his hat when regenia passed by in short her amiable disposition and unostentatious kindness soon made her the idol of the childrens parents as well as of the children

about a month after her arrival in grandville as she turned the corner on her way home from school one evening she came face to face with dr leighton she knew him instantly but hoping he had not recognized her mumbled out an excuse and hurried on

i have been up to your boarding house regenia and had started out to meet you said the doctor pleasantly

regenia being cleverly caught turned and spoke to him what in the world ever brought you here of all places he said friendly extending his hand which she pretended not to see

i am winning my way as a teacher what are you doing she interrogated in sharp contrast with his friendly greeting

this is my old home i came to see my folks and also to look after you he said laughingly you dropped out of the world so suddenly last december that finding you again comes in the nature of a resurrection

i am contented and well employed and while i thank you for your solicitation i am in no pressing need of a guardian she said giving the door bell a sharp jerk

mrs landers came hurriedly to the door to ascertain who rang so imperatively seeing it was only regenia she lifted her eyes indicative of surprise but spying dr leighton remarked oh it is you doctor come in

if regenia had thought to escape dr leighton by taking refuge in mrs landers boarding house she was not long in discovering her mistake frank leighton was better acquainted with this most excellent woman than regenia ever would be if she spent the remainder of a long life in her company the doctor therefore not in the least abashed entered closed the door talked as long as he desired and after signifying his intention to call often took his departure

it was with premonitions of dreaded contact with dr leighton regenia left her home for the school room the morning after the meeting described in the previous chapter around every corner as she hastened to and from school she expected to come face to face with him during the morning and until the last tardy pupil had come trooping in her nerves received a new shock at each opening of the door her fears were unnecessary dr leighton did not annoy her with his presence for many days he had wisely surmised that his sudden meeting with his cousin had served to increase rather than to lessen her fear of him

the dictation of a wise policy therefore kept him out of sight until the old dislike consequent upon his unexpected appearance was somewhat allayed

on one saturday afternoon allowing a few weeks to elapse the doctor called at regenias boarding house he found her in the parlor idly running over some music she had recently purchased

regenia drew back as if to leave the room when he entered

you need not run my fair cousin i do not intend to eat you up today you are not in prime condition he said with a laugh referring to her attenuated appearance

the life of a school marm does not seem to agree with you he continued interrogatively

regenia addressed in such a frank way could not consistently withdraw

i have never been an amazon she said laughing at the picture her words called up i have been flattering myself that i have grown stouter since i saw you last a shade of sorrow instantly flitting across her face at the remembrance of their last meeting at mt clare

dr leighton immediately changed the trend of the conversation it was verging toward a subject he feign would have blotted from the tablets of his mind

and do you really like your work he said betraying an interest in her occupation he did not feci

better than anything i ever did in my life she enthusiastically replied

i can easily believe that he said laughing in his old way in what work or business did you engage previous to your entering upon the present fascinating pastime

you understand what i mean she said laughing also i am truly fond of my work and love the children dearly in fact i never seemed to have lived or had any right to do so before now it is so different i seem to be living with a purpose living for ones self is not half so noble as living and laboring for others

a very excellent sentiment and wonderfully becoming to you my philanthropic little cousin and one that would make the world happier did everybody act upon it the charity of the most of us i fear too often begins and ends in the same placeâat home he added

it would not begin and end there i am sure she said were it not that most people lack opportunity to have brought to their doors through actual experience the old heavensent truth it is more blessed to give than to receive  regenia like most young people that have not been tainted by temptation and soiled by sin refused to believe the world as sordid and selfconcentered as it is often portrayed

and yet with all your faith in the ultimate good that dwells native in the human heart you pack up and run away from the only person whose right to look after you would pass unchallenged in any court in the world how do you reconcile your faith with your actions he asked in an injured tone

oh i do not try to reconcile anything i only know i could not have remained in mt clare another day if i had been sure death awaited me only a few miles from the place i was so bereaved so thoroughly miserable with my double sorrow that death anywhere in the wide round world would have been preferable to life at the elms 

i can understand he said kindly how you must have felt but do you think i was happy two mysterious disappearances in so short a time unstrung me also if you had only indicated that you wanted a change i should have been glad to have offered any assistance consistent with my duty as your guardian but to have you leave as you did with the ink that advertised the other lost one scarcely dry put me in a whirlpool of crossed purposes painful to relate he said covering his face with his hands as if to banish the distracting remembrance dropping his voice and speaking as if struggling with his long pent up feelings he continued i am at a loss even to surmise what designing wretch playing upon the credulity engendered by your recent great sorrow could have persuaded you to take a course so unnatural so contrary to what would have been expected from a girl of such an open trustful dispoposition as i know you to have

i did what i thought was best then and what i have thanked god every day since that i had the courage to do i sought advice from no one i simply followed the promptings of my own heart i am past the years when the law requires that i should have a guardian yet i am grateful to you she said relenting a little  that you offered to act in that capacity as i had to make my own way i resolved the sooner i set about it the better so taking counsel with my own sense of right i could not be dependent upon any one for my subsistence through the help of very kind friends i obtained an opportunity to come here i came and have nothing to regret

you were left a not very liberal allowance i admit the doctor replied but of course you must have understood that i intended to supplement that sufficiently to permit you to live on just as you had been living all your life

very true and i so understood it but changes come and i would have perhaps been obliged to take up the burden of life when less inclined to bear it so it is the best for all concerned that things happened as they did you meant well by me and i may have acted unadvisedly not to say unworthily but as all is well that ends well let us each take up the threads of our fallen shuttle and weave away careless of the texture of the cloth conscious that the great loom master will credit us for our diligence at the last

as she said this she rose indicating that the interview had shaped itself to a finality

dr leighton rose also and extending his hand said now that we understand each other i hope that we shall at least be friends

as you like it said regenia taking his hand i have no wish to be unfriendly to you or to judge too harshly what was perhaps providential she said as the doctor bowed himself down the steps

dr leighton owned to himself as he lighted a cigar and sauntered aimlessly down the street that he had not accomplished his purpose as easily as he had intended how the girl has changed he muttered thoroughly self possessed and as beautiful as venus

she had changed the weak weeping girl that he had thought to make the plaything of his caprice had passed through the school of adversity since the day she left him in the library of her deceased relative some girls are never women others leap to that estate by suffering in a day

the sands of time ran on in their usual groove the changeable winds of march followed by the showers of april had given place to the delightful days of may dr leighton came in now and then to pass an hour spend an afternoon or listen during the long balmy evenings to regenia play but oftener to bring some piece of new music to sing these calls were not sufficiently frequent nor so illy timed as to excite remark the doctor had told mrs landers frankly of the relation he bore to regenia and that discreet dame pandering to an innate love for southern aristocracy secretly rejoiced that she kept beneath her roof someone so nearly allied to this scion of blue blood

regenia spent a great deal of her spare time among her pupils no place was too humble no home too sordid to daunt the missionary spirit of this sweet young woman like an angel of mercy she moved in and out among the people carrying the sunshine of a helpful sympathy whereever she went if somebody was sick some pupil detained at home forth after nightfall sallied regenia to administer to the sick or look after the delinquent she brought to the homes of the poor and neglected something more than the necessities of life for while she administered too often it is to be feared from her meager wages to their physical wants she threw around them a subtle refinement a gentleness of touch a subdued sweetness more lasting than temporal blessings

one evening as she passed out of one house into another just across the way to make a last call and spend a quiet hour with a sick scholar whose convalescence seemed to depend upon her daily visits she observed as she entered the house a buggy standing beside the board walk in front of the door she turned the knob with gentle and continued pressure and glided like a sylph unannounced into the bed chamber of her little friend her intuition told her in a moment that a change for the worse had come over the patient she heard the doctor and the mother of the child conversing in a low tone in the adjoining room the little boy was groaning with pain and talking wildly she knelt beside the bed and stroking the sufferers head began to talk to him in that low soothing key that the gracious father has given only to the angel heart of woman the doctor noted the cessation of hard breathing and with a motion toward the mother to quiet her fears stepped lightly to the open door as he started to the door in his heart he verily believed all was over he stood a moment as if fixed to the spot he rubbed his eyes and looked a second time kneeling at the bedside her sad sweet face beside the little sufferer her hat filled with loose roses daily brought to comfort him the child under her magic touch had gone to sleep

he motioned to the mother who seeing regenia could not be restrained but pushing past the astonished doctor and clasping the girl in her big strong arms lifted her to her feet exclaiming god bless your dear life you are an angel sent from heaven i do believe

he is sleeping now said regenia oh i hope hell be better by morning

she had not noticed that a third party was an interested observer seeing the doctor she gave a little start then instantly gaining her selfcontrol she faced the stranger whom in the dim light she failed to recognize

reaching out his hand he said do you not know me miss underwood

dr stone she said unable to hide her astonishment

they stood there for some moments holding each others hand both too full of the thoughts of other days for uterance

this is indeed a doubly fortunate meetingâ fortunate for the child whose life not my medicine but your influence has saved and fortunate for me i never thought when i hurried out here tonight that my visit would be fraught with so much happiness

nor did i think of seeing you she replied

what a change from the scenes that surrounded us when last we met said he trying to divine if she too recurred to those happy days with regret

pleasure then but an hour of this is worth a lifetime of that she replied thinking of how little idle hours of fickle folly are to be compared with earnest sacrifice for the good of others

it depends upon the value of the standard we use as a unit of comparison he replied thinking how readily he would exchange a month of the halfpayed responsibilities of his thankless lot for about an hour of that blessed carefree conclave week

i did not know you were in the south he continued how long have you been here and what mad notion of selfsacrifice has driven you from the delights of mtclare and the elms to try conclusions with the world in this hamlet of sin and vice in his heart he disliked the very idea of regenia the sweet regenia of his dreams living and laboring among such surroundings

to answer your first question she said i have been here since last january and while it will despoil my mission of half its poetic glamour to confess it candor compels me to say that not fanatic notions of self sacrifice but stern necessity if not a harder a more exacting master brought me here to win my bread by teaching you here and a teacher exclaimed the doctor not knowing whether he was more astonished or delighted at the news his ears were hearing where are you stopping

regenia named the street

oh you are up in town i drive past there you will let me give you a lift he said drawing on his gloves and hastily giving a few final instructions to the mother of the sick child

after promising to return the next morning on her way to school regenia bade the grateful mother a cheery good night and was handed into dr lotus stones buggy where as they drove along never faster than a walk the moons broken reflections fell on new life for them both

when lotus stone graduated from the college of physicians and surgeons he was for weeks undecided where he would begin the practice of his profession he certainly did not intend to settle in grandville from the very first he had however turned his eyes southward why he preferred the south has been previously mentioned weighing the advantages of two places toward which his mind had inclined he wrote to his old school fellow at minton for an opinion upon the relative advantages of the places selected in this letter to clement he stated at large his view of the probabilities and drawbacks that might attend the beginning of his professional life in either place to this friendly renewal of the confidence which had been somewhat shattered in the months that had elapsed since their conclave experience clement made an immediate reply he did not however favor either of the places between which lotus was inclined to make choice but recommended instead the flourishing city of grandville he pointed out the advantages of the new industrial life the place had taken on and demonstrated the fine opening for surgical practice that would be sure to come to him through the daily accidents occurring about a plant of this description

clement was too well acquainted with the unreasonable pride of his friend however to give the reason uppermost in his mind dr lotus stone went south confident that he was leaving regenia underwood and his heart under the waving elms of mt clare what his feelings were the night he found the angelic apparition pursuing her deeds of mercy among the shacks on the outskirts of grandville is left for the reader to conjecture

as they drove along that night beneath the moonlit southern sky a sense of serene contentment which he had never before experienced stole into the heart of the young doctor

what an unexpected delight he said i cannot realize that it is not an evanescent dream miss underwood in grandville the thought is too preposterous to be true

and yet you are here can you not reconcile yourself to my presence as well as account for your own she replied lightly

i cannot say i can my intention from the first was to come to the south if you remember your ideas were decidedly against it

 circumstances alter cases says a wise old saw and i am as enthusiastically in favor of the south as the place for work and race development tonight as i was opposed to it when we discussed the subject last she said

where are mrs underwood and mrs levitt how i have lived over the few bright days spent in mt clare that conclave to me i have often thought since was the one glimpse of paradise given a man at rare intervals on this earth of sad regrets and bitter disappointments he said lost in the afterthought which his mention of mrs underwood and mrs levitts names re called

the first is dead replied regenia with as much calmness as she could command mrs levitt poor poor dear no one knows what has âbecome of her

i did not know that he said apologetically pardon me if in my ignorance i have given you pain

apologies are unnecessary she said ask me what you will it seems ages since i heard from kindly lips the mention of those two names your reference to them is rather in the nature of a blessing than otherwise grandmother died the night lucile and mr st john were married she hastened to say i was not at home and know but little of the cause of her sudden demise mrs levitt left home to go to church a few sunday nights following and has never been heard of since dr leighton advertised and employed detectives to search for her but the only evidence of her existence ever disclosed was her shawl near the ferry landing at the foot of scranton street

and left alone he repeated slowly your property in the hands of dr leighton you came south seeking bread oh the burning shame of it that dr leighton could permit anything so revolting

no you do the doctor an unintentional injustice he possesses the property and offered to take care of me but i refused to accept his offer and came forth into the world of my own volition to support myself

brave little girl said the doctor attempting to take her hand regenia drew back he instantly saw his mistake and hurriedly asked does st john know of all this he asked this in a half resentful mood not knowing whether to spend his chagrin on the inoffensive head of his old friend or apologize for the thoughtless familiarity his sympathy had betrayed him into

oh yes i told lucile and mr st john everything mr st john is my best friend through his kindness i came south

for the first time it occurred to lotus why clemnt had sent him to grandville and if he had ever felt angry with his bighearted friend the remembrance of the service he had done him in directing his footsteps to grandville made ample amends

have you heard from mr st john lately she asked archly

lotus was on his guard in a moment he divined that she was trying to ascertain whether the knowledge that she was in grandville had not figured largely in sending him there

clement and i have not corresponded regularly since i left washington i am ashamed to confess the fault lay at my door however i am a poor letter writer

so i have observed she said reproachfully she would have given a great deal to take those four words back what must he think of me she thought

he thinks you an angel is what he would have answered if he could have listened to the murmuring of your mental graphophone

he said and are you a better correspondent it seems to me that you some times fail in that respect as well as myself

promptness in letter writing is my one virtue i never received a letter that i did not answer

did you never receive a letter from me he asked excitedly

never she replied

then we have an enemy that will not scruple at anything toâtoâmake us unfriendly i wrote to you from washington as soon as i reached that city i also wrote you twice from new york receiving no reply to either letter i concluded that you did not care to pursue my acquaintance further

regenia listened to what he was saying as if stupefied the old question recurred who is my enemy the old answer was on her lipsâ the accusation which she had mentally made a thousand times but ties of consanguinity restrained her

they were nearing the house as the buggy turned the corner into fourth street dr leighton leaning against a tree on the sidewalk beheld a sight which made his heart stand still dr lotus stone and regenia drove up to mrs landers the doctor alighted and assisted regenia to the curb stood there until the door opened then entering his buggy drove rapidly past dr leighton a second time in the direction of the steel plant dr leighton watched the buggy until it was lost in the darkness then uttering a terrible oath crossed the street and entered a nearby saloon

as regenia bade dr stone goodnight she invited him politely to come and see her some time

the words rang in his ears as he drove along in the moonlight come and see me some time he said over and over now in a whisper now half audibly come and see me some time as if he would not he thought come and see you i would if every window pane in that old brick house was darkened with a siege gun faster and faster he drove until the red light of the furnace was only a reflection in the distance the unspoken yearning of his heart filled him with a wild desire to drive on and on until day should come and with it one more sight of the woman he loved how he loved her he had not realized until chance again brought them face to face he thought of clement and reining his horse turned toward grandville and drove back home to write to clement beg his forgiveness for the negligence of the past and tell above all things about regenia

the next day seemed so long dr stone could not endure the wait until evening but drove out to see the sick child he had visited the night before he excused himself to the mother by saying that he was called out there anyway and to save two trips came to her in the afternoon he said the same thing to regenia he was called to see a patient and dropped up to look in on her olive branches incidentally he remained however until school closed and drove regenia home

dr stone had not been in regenias company a second time until he saw what dr leighton had discovered the regenia of mt clare and the elms was not the selfpossessed young lady whose shadow he was preparing himself to follow about the city of grandville if he booked upon the former friendship between himself and regenia he was soon made aware of his mistake throwing the past to the winds he commenced anew to study the object of his intended conquest madly in love from the very first the doctor was unable to hide the fact from the sharp eyes of regenia she received his visits however on the same footing which any other young man of the city came with native cleverness she succeeded in hiding her own feelings from the blind eyes of the enamored doctor he knew he loved her to distraction and only wanted an opportunity to declare his love this opportunity regenia always managed to elude on the brink of a declaration she would suddenly leave the room if out driving she would naively call his attention to some sight or scene that tended to drift the conversation in an opposite direction in this way matters stood at the close of her school school closed the last of may it was indeed a trying time to regenia days of exacting labor and sleepless nights of nervous headache she had more than once declared to dr stone that she did not believe she could hold out if school closed the last of june as it does for the most part throughout the north the children were as excited and anxious about the last day as their teacher to them it was a day fraught with momentous import at last the day came and with it such a crowd of proud mothers and doting indulgent fathers as the building could not have contained if it had been twice or three times its present size both the teacher and the school had in some way gained a notoriety beyond the confines of the steel plant and the city on whose outskirts it stood

many persons from the city and even trustees of country schools from the neighboring districts had made it a point to ride or drive in to the city to be present at the closing exercises of regenias school dr lotus stone of course was present also dr frank leighton these two gentlemen together with a number of the clergymen of large and small fry were there to give dignity to the occasion chief among the latter class was the rev ananias foggs his vest buttoned to the throat and wearing a new white cravat probably not more than five or six months old those who could not pack in the house hung in the windows and made life in that room anything but pleasant the examination as it was called but to the initiated it was only a rehearsal was pronounced to be a tremendous success the work was indeed commendable to the intelligence and painstaking labor of the teacher near the door on a table were displayed specimens of the pupils writing these specimens together with the copybooks were put into the hands of a committee to decide which was the best and award the prize to the successful competitor dr stone dr leighton and one of the ministers were chosen by regenia to perform this important function while the committee was making its decision the time of all times to the afroamerican was spent in telling the children how they the speakers would have improved this chance if it had only been offered them a statement however which must be swallowed with due caution judging from the way some of them have improved their time the committee finally reported and dr leighton was asked to present the prize this he did in such a pleasing way that not only regenia and her visitors were delighted but dr stone was obliged to relent some of the hard things he had been thinking of his professional brother the trustees held a meeting at the close of the exercises elected regenia to take charge of the school during the year next ensuing and also made arrangements for an assistant regenia was highly pleased with the complimentary things which both dr stone and her cousin poured out without restraint

she drove home with dr stone the next day regenia was to leave grandville for the north dr stone sought in vain that evening to draw her aside and declare his love but she adroitly avoided every intrusion of sentiment

when the doctor left that evening he held out his hand to say goodbye

not goodbye but adieu will you not see me at the station

no he said i will send the buggy around i am engaged at the very hour your train leaves he replied holding her hand

then i shall not see you again she said evincing no little disappointment

not until you return his grasp tightened he thought he felt a return of the pressure

will you not let me say just one word he pleaded will younot at least hear my confession do you not love me just a little

her head lowered and turning she said now goodbye and oh i shall thank you and thinkof you ever so much when i get away from here

the next day the doctors buggy drove regenia to the station but dr stone had to forego a pleasure that was hard to bear but what could he not bear when the happiness of the woman he loved was at stake

standing at the one window of the room where we left her six months ago prematurely old and gray beyond recognition looking out at the grim lighthouse and watching the glinting rays of the setting sun as their reflections fall aslant the restless waters is mrs levitt sometimes praying oftener singing and talking to herself she passes her days within the enclosure of those four walls believing herself forgotten by the world she begins to wear the look of stolid indifference characteristic of the hopeless

several times in the last few months almost crazed by the gnawings of hunger and the bitter cold shehas been on the verge of betraying her trust and for the sake of freedom disclosing her knowledge of mrs underwoods last wishes at such times however she would think of regenia and what an opportunity it would give dr leighton to wrong her and bearing her misfortunes she had resolved to hold out a little longer escape she has long since despaired of the lighthousekeepers wife had on several occasions showed that only fear of the cruel brute she had promised to love and obey kept her from treating mrs levitt with that leniency her age and sex demanded if dr leighton had searched the world over he could not have found a man more thoroughly devoid of human qualities than this drunken lighthousekeeper a human vulture would have been an angel of sweetness and light beside this man he had answered a heartrending plea of mrslevitts during the coldest night of that long severe winter to be allowed to come out and warm by a most unmerciful beating the wretch kicked and bruised the helpless old woman until fearing he had killed her he slunk off to the lighthouse and remained all night when his wife drew mrs levitt out to the fire and bathed her bruises she was more dead than alive

why did he not kill me the old lady gasped i should much prefer death to the life i am living

i am so sorry but hes in his cups and when hes a drinkin theres no doin ner livin fer im if id said a word hed like as not pitched onto me

mrs levitt was not long in detecting the note of true sympathy in the womans voice

what do they intend to do with me anyhow i am nothing but an old woman of little account to myself and of less service to anybody else

dear me dogged fi know what they mean lawsame that man wouldnt tell me nothin fis a dyin

how can you live with such a brute said mrs levitt indignantly

hes my man an i spose if fi didnt live with him plenty others would

may be so replied mrs levitt growing sleepy under the influence of the warm fire let me sleep here before the fire tonight wont you if i was to die in this house from ill treatment there would be no living here afterward

why ye wouldnt come back would ye queried the woman shivering with fear at the very thought of such a probability

of course my spirit would hover around that lighthouse and in this room as long as they stayed here said mrs levitt now fully awakened to the fact that by playing upon the womans superstitious fears she might obtain at least a little more humane treatment

at that moment a gust of wind blew the door open and the light which flickered and sputtered in a pan of swimming fat went out

by the dim glare of the wood fire burning low the shadows of the waving trees fell in wierd and grotesque figures on the walls of the room the coincidence was providential the woman stealthily walked to the door and pushed it shut she came back to the fire and stood stretching out her long lean fingers while she narrowly watched mrs levitt

finally lighting the tallow dip she said ive often heern kullard folks could conjure kin you do that

dont trouble me now said mrs levitt i am sleepy

the woman pulled mrs levitts bed in before the fire helped her into it blew out the candle and went to bed herself from that time forward she secretly connived at many little privileges mrs levitt took

the only incident concerning this story necessary to relate is the plan mrs levitt devised to communicate with her friends as the summer came on she was sometimes allowed to sit in the door while the woman who was for the most part her guard worked in the garden or about the house this was a coveted privilege mrs levitts rheumatism made escape impossible

one day seeing some hunters come by and knowing that they would probably pass that way again on their return to the city she racked her brain for some device to send a message by them at last she fell upon this plan she procured a strip of brown paper and with a piece of charred wood sharpened to a point scratched these words i am a prisoner at lighthouse n w of mt clare on road crossing scranton street ferry

mrs levitt

she did not believe that regenia was still at the elms and as she could think of no other address she turned the paper over and scrawled on the back mr lotus stone washington d c

this she concealed about her clothing and watched for the return of the hunters a few days afterward she succeeded by dint of bribing and playing upon the superstitious fears of the lighthousekeepers wife to smuggle the note into the hands of one of the hunters and get his promise to properly address and mail it

about this time drstone was beginning to reap golden opinions in the practice of his profession regenia was with clement and lucile and dr frank leighton secure in his possessions had begun to congratulate himself that all is well that ends well

let us look in on dr lotus stone who seated by the window on this june evening is reading his first letter from regenia there is a look of disappointment on his face as if the contents of the letter were not to his liking he reads it over and over again vainly trying to extract some meaning from between the lines that he is morally certain is ndt there and ought not to be there and no one would have been more surprised than he if it had been there yet he is looking for it the letter is frank and informal to a remarkable degree for a first letter she tells him all about clement and lucile and the kind friends in the north and how they were all talking of him the evening she wrote and at last one little word that a less obtuse man than lotus stone would have seized upon and hugged the flattering unction to his heart this was the sentence t have not forgiven you for not coming to the station to see the last of me

as he sat there musing over the letter dr leighton came in the doctor had called several times since the incident at the closing of regenias school lotus was not only pleased to talk with a physician of dr leightons experience and well known celebrity but flattered to have him call lotus stone was neither vindictive nor suspicious the pleasing manner and apparent interest which dr leighton evinced in the success of the young physician was not long in winning to a limited extent his confidence this evening he brought some book of rare value to the profession and asked lotus to keep it and read it this kind of treatment is not at all unusual in the south the educated professional men of all classes are rarely unkind to their brothers in black it is to be doubted if in the north there is half the courtesy between professional men of opposite races as there exists in the south in this way dr leighton and dr stone often spent an evening investigating some subject or discussing some disputed point in which the older mans wide experience and thorough scholarship gave to his opinions on some subjects the weight of an authority

hello reading a letter from your girl he said cheerily as he entered i have brought you the book i was telling you about

lotus folded the letter placed it in his pocket and picking up the book remarked thank you ill look over it when i have time and while he turned to the index of the book to look up a subject on which he wished to compare the assertions of the author with one of the well known opinions of one of his favorites dr leighton picked up the envelope glanced at the postmark and said from regenia how is my fair cousin

all o k said lotus

where is she she promised to write to me but i suppose she naturally thinks of you first

she is at minton at st johns lotus replied

i remember him wonder you wouldnt marry regenia doctor

i wonder if i wouldnt if i could get her over to my way of thinking she dont seem to go in for that sort of a thing much said dr stone laughingly

you dont use the right kind of bait ask her again any woman will marry you if you are persistent enough

it has not gone that far i would not ask a woman to be my wife unless i had more assurance of making her a comfortable living than i have found in my presnt locality said dr stone

he changed the subject and the two men sat there smoking and talking until far into the night when dr leighton left dr stones office he swore by all the stars never to go there again on any pretext he knew in part now what he had every reason to believe before lotus stone wanted and ultimately would marry regenia so far his suit was not successful regenia has leighton enough in her blood not to show her hand until she is ready to play her cards he said aloud at heart he rather liked lotus stone but having taken so many chances in the desperate game he was playing should he let professional courtesy keep him from separating these two people if he didi not fear dr stones superior intelligence would ferret out the real reason why mr levitt disappeared he might go further and do moreâproduce mrs levitt herself âand thus balk entirely the game that up to the present he had played without an error

lighting a cigar and drifting into a saloon he found a worthless spittoon cleaner sitting there nursing a broken leg

hello abe whats the matter

down wid broken laig doctah

why didnt you come around and let me fix it up for you 

i had that new fellow to fix it up for me but i dont believe he knowed what he was doin pears to me its worse now than it was at first the doctor examined the leg and found it had been set once and before the fracture healed it had been broken again in the same place

who did you say reduced this fracture asked the doctor

what you say massa leighton

who set the bone for you repeated the doctor

oh that new doctahâwhats his name oh yes thats it dr stone repeating after dr leighton

taking the halfdrunken wholly profligate old negro into a back room the doctor reset the broken limb and ordered him home to remain until his leg was better

time sped on wings so rapidly did it pass during regenias stay in the north with her pleasant friends she did not visit mt clare during her stay why should she when everything there would but serve to recall sad memories of past happiness which she verily believed could never return she remained in minton three months in the closing days of september she prepared to return to the home of her adoption happy as her stay in minton had been she was anxious to go back to grandville thoroughly rested she longed to take up the work of her choice as was noted in a previous chapter the trustees had promised on the closing day of school to enlarge the building and increase the teaching force they had fulfilled their promise regenia had been requested by them to bring another teacher when she came to take the new place accordingly she induced one of her friends in minton to go south and accept the positon the trip was barren of incidents until they reached colerain here for the first time they were made to feel the iron of that discrimination so trying to afroamericans of culture and refinement as the two girls left the coach at colerain and essayed to enter the ladies waiting room a bleareyed attendant in the employ of the railroad stopped them

is that girl your servant he curtly asked

no said regenia she is my friend

walk right in the other door he said pointing toward an adjoining waiting room

is that the place for ladies she asked in surprise

no thats the place for niggahs  he said gruffly so go along and dont make any trouble he continued taking regenia by the shoulders and starting her sharply in the direction indicated

the girls thoroughly frightened did not wait a second command but meekly obeyed orders regenias friend although perhaps her superior in acquisitiveness her equal in grace and refinement was unmistakably an afroamerican the waiting room for negroes was the smoking room for everybody else amid a cloud of smoke and the insulting stare of coarse white men and rude negroes the two young ladies hid away in a corner of the room here they sat too scared to be indignant smarting under the insult but too much cowed by their surroundings to protest fortunately their stay in colerain was short with feelings of relief amounting almost to buoyancy they welcomed the signal to get aboard for grandville their buoyancy however was very short lived they had hardly settled comfortably in their seats before a trainman came in and taking up their traveling bags politely asked them to follow him into the other coach

in vain they protested that they were satisfied to remain where they were but all to no purpose the new teacher indignantly refused to go regenia had started but the intended assistant took hold of her superior and with more force than politeness compelled her to remain

we have first class tickets said the spirted assistant you have no right to charge first class fare for second class accommodations

right or wrong i have orders to seat you in the forward coach and i intend to do so at all hazards said the trainman

suiting the action to the word he caught the brave girl by the arm and hustled her unceremoniously into the smoking car regenia meekly followed

in the coach the girls left sat two dozen americans distinguished the world over for their knightly consideration for the rights of women but not a word was said not a protest offered as this slender unoffending daughter of eve was dragged to the smoking car by the heartless executor of an outrageous public sentiment

a heathen chinee who was an interested observer pushed his pigtail further up under his hat settled himself comfortably in the seat the two girls had vacated drew from his pocket a late copy of the foo choo chronicle and with an air of conscious superiority playing in the corner of his almond eyes mused while he pretended to read upon the wide difference between american theory and practice the car these two refined american women were compelled by the hard fate of a cowardly public sentiment to enter would have been disgraceful to use for cattle the air was thick with every odor that burning tobacco could produce ribald stories went the rounds and bad whisky played no minor part in the hilarity of the crowd

the girls sat all that long night with their faces out of the windows trying in vain to get a pure breath of air we need not linger over the sickening details of this unhappy journey what they suffered that night would be harrowing to relate at daylight to the intense relief of two passengers at least the train reached grandville the girls dragged themselves from the coach and hurried to regenias boarding house

still smarting under the refusal of dr stone to â see her off when she left in june it was with feelings akin to resentment she went down to meet him on the night of her arrival after the usual greetings she introduced her friend who came with her

miss wilson for that was the girls name immediately launched into an unreserved denunciation of the treatment received on their way to grandville

you must look for that sort of thing here but do not denounce too severely the employee as he said he was only obeying orders remarked dr stone

no orders could ever make a real gentleman rude to a lady answered miss wilson hotly i never wished i were a man before yesterday if the men of our race had half the courage of the women they would stand by their rights to the bitter death

that would be about the size of it said lotus cooly

what would be the size of it

death thats all said lotus lightly

well one has but one time to die i would rather a thousand times die in defense of my rights than live a cowardly poltroon the scorn of every selfrespecting man on earth is life so sweet or existence teeming with so many awaiting pleasures that to hold on to a few more uncertain days of it we must suffer any indignity if we may only be allowed to live asked the angry girl

all you say is true enough but it is hard to get discreet men to act upon your advice we all like to live i hardly know why unless it is because we are built that way said lotus laughing but to be serious it is probably the hope of a better day that restrains men from flying into the face of fate and heroically surrendering their all to let the world stop long enough to sigh one more unfortunate 

is it getting better doctor or worse asked regenia as one by one the old safeguards once thought necessary are being removed i confess my faith in a better day is growing weaker

the better day is coming if in the language of an old friend of mine its away off just as the asperities that once existed between the north and south are gradually melting away and the old fraternal ties are being more endurably welded so against all reason perhaps i believe that the real heart of the south is measurably softening toward us the reign of the poor whites has reached that point where it is a stench in the nostrils of the better classes everywhere we must not lose faith he said nodding toward regenia we must look into the frowning face of blackest night for the rosy hues of coming morning have faith to believe that through the gathering clouds of social and political despair will break the glorious sunlight of a new emancipation

it is helpful to listen to the avowal of such faith but in the fierce light of the past days experience i am unable to agree with you said miss wilson

our greatest hope lies in the noble women of our race said the doctor politely

our greatest hindrance perhaps m our cowardly lecherous men said miss wilson with this parting shot she excused herself and left the room

i suppose it is patent to you now why i did not accompany you to the station said the doctor as the door closed after miss wilson

not exactly said regenia

if you had not been accompanied on your return the second trip south would have been as barren of annoyance as the first if i had escorted you to the station in any other capacity than a servant you would have left grandville in a smoking car under those circumstances you would not have returned for ten minutes pleasure i would have sacrificed many happy hours he said laughing

i should have preferred my friends to accompany me to the station if a smoking car did loom up as the result said regenia

certainly you would said lotus and for that very reason none of your friends would unnecessarily subject you through their thoughtlessness to that indignity it is glorious to have the power of a king but it is tyrannical to use it your unselfishness is proverbial should i be less unselfish you would risk all for your friends but he would be a selfish man indeed who would permit you to do so when threading the perils of a lone woman on a southern railway car

the doctor soon departed as regenia lowered the gas and started to her room she nearly collided with mr foggs as he hove from the dining room breathing like a freight engine going up grade and pulling about as heavy a load considering the difference in horse power

ah miss underwood come and shake hands with me i havent laid these two eyes on you since your return mrs landers informed me this evening that you were back among us he said trying to stand still

i am very glad to be back said regenia politely

come and give me a kiss wont you said the reverend bracing himself and starting toward her

regenia moved further away but was evidently speechless with indignation and astonishment as she attempted to escape him and pass through the door he caught her by the hand and attempted to embrace her

what do you mean she said

dont get angry i dont mean no harm you do not make so much fuss i lay you when that white doctor tries to kiss you he said with a satanic grin

regenias anger knew no bounds she unloosed his grasp and before she thought had given the lecherous drunken old hypocrite such a slap in the face that the impact awakened mrs landers from her doze in the kitchen the sudden belligerency put forth by regenia by its very energy frightened her from the field

it sobered old foggs sufficiently to make an untruthful explanation to mrs landers and present regenias side of the case in a most uncomplimentary light regenia had not heard the last of that foul slander repeated by mr foggs from that night whenever the young girls name is mentioned he will with many expressions of unbelief repeat the story connecting it with dr leightons

thus it is ever the cormorants of society whenever their familiarities are rebuffed wreak their vengeance upon the innocent by sly insinuations intended to ruin the character of those who defend their honor

when regenia awakened the next morning the sun was high in the heavens the accusation made by mr foggs together with his coarse familiarity had served to keep her sleeplessly tossing from one side of the bed to the other the most of the night she came down to a late breakfast still nervous and excited for the first time during her short life she felt the poisonous sting of slander conscious of her innocence she knew how impossible it is to defend a pure life against the insidious touches of that hidden serpentâa lie she knew too well that error traveled like the hare while truth took the gait of the tortoise

mrs landers observed the forlorn look in regenias face as she left the table her breakfast untouched she could not eat the cankerous lie had already robbed her of her roses she returned to her room locked the door and throwing herself across the bed gave way to a fit of passionate weeping again and again did miss wilson tap at the door only to receive no reply she could hear regenias bitter heartrending sobs but was powerless to take her that comfort which she knew her companion needed regenia had gone directly to her own room the night before and consequently miss wilson was in blissful ignorance of the cause of her trouble

in the afternoon dr leighton called he sent up his card but regenia refused to make any answer to mrs landers repeated raps at her door mrs landers was for awhile nonplussed but finally succeeded in opening the door regenia with swollen eyes and hair awry was sitting on the bed when she entered

why did you not open the door demanded mrs landers in a peremptory way

because i did not wish to be disturbed said regenia

dr leighton is in the parlor and wishes to see you said mrs landers a triumphant smile lurking about the corners of her mouth

tell him i am indisposed said regenia her color heightening in spite of herself

mrs landers descended to the parlor and shortly returned with dr leightons message

dr leighton wishes to come up and see you if you are ill she said

i have no malady he can cure now please go away i am sick and tired of everybody

you certainly do not object to seeing dr leighton after striking mr foggs for the mere mention of his name said mrs landers spitefully

thats my affair said regenia and i am under no compulsion to make any explanation to you about it

you are under obligations to treat people with common politeness as long as you stay in my house said mrs landers hotly

i try always to be polite answered regenia but if your company is as ill bred as that swaggering familiar old inebriate foggs i wish to be delivered from any contact with them in any way

you need not put on any of your hightoned airs she replied sally landers knows a thing or two and can call the turn on miss regenia underwood as well as a good many other high steppers in this town if she is a mind to she fairly hissed these words out as she left the room slamming the door after her

regenia had risen from the bed where she had been sitting she stood there like a statue for some time after mrs landers in a towering rage had left the room what to do she hardly knew she was not long in reaching a decision necessity is a great encourager of hesitancy she washed her face put on her hat and went over to miss wilsons room she told her the cause of her trouble

there was one other person to whom regenia lost no time in relating her story and asking his advice rev simon thomas was one of the ministers who lived and labored among the people surrounding the steel plant because he saw in administering to the poor an exemplification of his humble master with him sacrifice for the master was a labor of love in the midst of temptations and crime he led the life of a saint his sermons were as simple and free from ostentation as his life was pure and humble he met every requirement of goldsmiths ideal preacher who pointed to heaven and led the way

his wife mother thomas as she was familiarly called was a fitting companion for such a husband in her works of charity she had met regenia and learned to love her it was therefore into sympathetic ears regenia poured her tale of mistreatment when she had finished mrs thomas said to her husband simon go out and get an express and send it over to mrs landers to get miss underwoods trunk then turning to regenia and putting her arm around the young girls shoulders she said you will stay here with us dear we understand you how often had regenia heard almost the same loving words when she had gone with some of her troubles to mrs levitt it all came back now as her troubled head lay upon mother thomas shoulder and the load ol pain and anguish floated away with the tide of grateful tears that chased each other down her cheeks after a while the good woman said come to your room dear and lie down until supper by that time simon will have your trunk sent up

as rev simon thomas was an ideal minister so his home was an ideal home his house the only twostory frame about the steel plant had been the dwelling of the original owner of the land from whom the syndicate had purchased the site for their new enterprise in time regenia was thoroughly domesticated not as a boarder but as a member of the family

monday came and with it the reopening of school the division of the work and the new classification necessary kept regenia so fully occupied that she had hardly time to think of the sorrow that overshadowed her weeks ran rapidly into a month before regenia was reminded of that most pleasant of all days to a teacherâpay day

dr leighton had tried every way to see regenia but for a month had signally failed at last he went to the school regenia received him as she would have received any other visitor but went on with her work as if he was not present he remained until school closed hoping in this way to have a word with her if he hoped to force regenia to recognize him he was not long in learning his mistake having dismissed school she called two of her girls and taking them by the hand she walked to her home dr leighton could scarcely hide his chagrin

dr stone hardly allowed a day to pass that he did not manage to see regenia his fertility in manufacturing new excuses for visiting the parsonage was as amusing as ingenious regenia was an enigma to dr stone he had made a dozen futile attempts to declare his neverdying love for her but on every occasion some trivial occurrence real or imaginary had served to divert her from the burning issue she had neither encouraged his attentions nor had she discouraged them he had given her numberless opportunities to say yes but she had not accepted them she had also an equal number of chances to say no but she had not availed herself of them her apparent serenity in the face of his evident devotion he could not understand

one evening in november the doctor had driven over to irondale as the steel plant was beginning to be called to see a patient and as usual stopped at the parsonage for some reason he was low spirited and on that account was rather a grewsome visitor regenia was in high spirits

what has gone wrong she asked you are as melancholy as the oft depicted dane nothing is wrong that is not usually so he answered am i such a dull companion that my room tonight would be more cheerful than my presence he asked petulantly

oh no regenia answered lightly any kind of company is preferable to being alone i am alone tonight

and as you are alone you can even endure me he said ruefully

dont talk like that you must know how glad i am always to have you come she said kindly come let us have some music that will charm back your spirits and drive the blue devils away as poor mrs levitt used to say

what shall i sing she asked as she seated herself at the piano and began in a dreamy way to play she chose something light and airy and as she sung lotus sat listening and watching her nimble fingers dance over the keys

now she said when the song was ended i have sung for you come and sing for me

he walked over to the music rack and having selected a simple ballad placed it upon the piano saying i will sing this

as you like it she said as she ran over the prelude regenia thought as she listened to the song that never in her life had she heard such a world of subdued pathos

adieu when next our pathways meet when down lifes stream our boats a little space have flown will you forget our converse sweet the past the happy past unknown

will you forget perchance regret the nights ambrosial days of idle dreaming the songs we sung when love was young and earth a paradise was seeming 

when the days shall lengthen into years and seared and yellow life itself has grown will you resentful or with grateful tears seal the past the happy past unknown

will you forget perchance regret the nights ambrosial days of idle dreaming the songs we sung when love was young and earth a paradise was seeming

when the last note of the song ceased regenia arose and walked over to the window unable to keep back the tears lotus followed her and taking her hand said i have waited so long dear heart you must hear me for somehow i am unable to stifle the belief that something dreadful that will separate us for years is about to transpire

you must not feel that way you are only morbid and the song has served to intensify that feeling replied regenia

regenia darling i cannot live without you you must know i worship i adore you will you not promise to love me just a little he pleaded

oh how can you ask me such a question she said her voice falling almost to a whisper

how can i help asking he replied his faint heart sinking

do you not know i love you she said at the same time bursting into happy tears

for a moment it seemed to lotus stone that the low ceiling of that dingy parlor was lifted into a vaulted dome and a ray of light from heaven gilded it with celestial brightness

pressing the drooping head to his bosom he covered regenias face with passionate kisses

my love my life and are you at last my very own as he uttered these words steps were heard on the porch and a sudden noise at the window made the two loving hearts stand still the door was opened and mr thomas and his wife came in from prayer meeting

after the untimely interruption lotus was in no mood to prolong his stay regenia making an excuse to run over to a neighbors accompanied her lover to the corner where his horse was tied

the night was beautiful the full moon playing hideandseek with the clouds hid her face just often enough to make the night an ideal one for lovers

lotus insisted that regenia go with him for a drive but she did not accept his urgent invitation she stood for a moment watching him as he slowly drove away half inclined to come back and go with him the buggy turned a corner and she walked slowly in the opposite direction performed the duty which she had set out to accomplish and in a brown study was returning to her home when just as she was entering the back gate she came face to face with dr leighton his back against the gate standing under the shade of a giant tree whose abundant foliage hid him completely from view he smoked his favorite havana with no apparent intention of moving to give her entrance

regenia screamed with fright as she nearly ran into the smoking statue

hush he said there is no occasion for fear his words served to reassure her

dr leighton how you scared me what are you doing here

i might ask the same of you he answered with cool assurance

i live here she replied i fail to see the impropriety of entering my own house

the impropriety preceded your attempt to enter perhaps he said tauntingly

let me pass i will not stand here and listen to your implied insults

dont be in a rush i have had a word to whisper in your ear for sometime but untoward circumstances robbed me of the opportunity it is a case of now or never and i have decided to take the bit between my teeth irregardless of consequences he said in a cold villianous tone she turned to retrace her steps but he caught her by the wrist and prevented her

stay regenia i have something to relate that concerns your friend instantly she was all attention you might as well hear me calmly he continued with provoking deliberation to make a scene and awaken the neighborhood would only injure you you are not in mt clare

she knew too well how truthfuly he spoke

what have you to say that concerns my friend she asked her excitement having vanished at the very mention of dr stones name

not so fast we are in no hurry what i have to say about your friend the doctor will keep to return to the first question what are you doing away from your home at such an hour

i consider such a question the height of impertinence you are neither my guardian nor father confessor she said sharply

suppose i was both or either what account of your warbling lover would you give

such a supposition is preposterous since  have passed the age when i need the first and you are too wicked to assume the role of the secondâ especialy with me

i hope you will live long enough to verify that opinion he answered ironically

oh as to that i have lived more than long enough to know that dr leighton is not the friend he pretends to be answered regenia disdainfully

dr stone comes up to your ideal i hope judging from a painful discovery i made tonight his theatrical platitudes were useless however he did well to make the most of his chancesâthis was his last laughed the doctor scornfully

what do you mean said regenia now thoroughly alarmed for the safety of lotus

he is arrested he sleeps tonight behind prison bars he cooly averred

this is some of your work it is in keeping with what i already know of you

have a care young lady you are in my power he answered angrily

what do i care for you or your power revolted regenia

you had better care he answered under his breath

oh i do not fear you coward forger thief villian she kissed

shut up he said or by the gods ill throttle you hissed dr leighton assuming a threatening attitude

do it it will be a fitting climax to the other crimes you have committedâforged a will spirited away perhaps murdered an innocent old woman killed your own aunt and now you are planning the murder of a man toward whom you have been masquerading as a friend the sum of your villianies would be incomplete without my life take it but remember dr leighton there is a day of terrible retribution awaiting you a day when the black page of your checkered career will be made manifest

stop he cried you minx i will strangle you throwing himself upon the girl his fingers on her throat tightened she tried to release herself but it was of no use

ill shut your mouth you indiscreet little fool he muttered as the girl writhed and twisted beneath his iron grasp slowly she sank toward the earth her muscles began to relax she had given up to die when a black hand from out the darkness closed about the neck of dr frank leighton with the power of a vise he slowly unclasp his hands from regenias neck and as his face slowly turned up to the moonlight he looked into the flashing eyes of a black hero already marked for death the giant lifted the wouldbe murderer from the ground tightening his hold until the victims face took on the hue of his antagonists walking across the road that followed the creek bank in its tortuous route he dropped dr leighton more dead than alive into the sand below then coming back he picked up the unconscious girl and carried her into the house he cautioned the inmates to keep the matter quiet and await developments

a shiver of horror crept over dr stone as he raised himself heavily from the iron bed upon which he had passed the night on the morning after we last saw him slowly driving away from the parsonage self admitted the happiest man in the world the events of that night the reader has been led to anticipate from the words which escaped dr leighton in his conversation with regenia dr stone drove home put away his horse for the night and had just time enough to settle himself comfortably in his chair light a cigar and open a letter which he was about to read when an imperative knock called him to the door two officers stepped inside and presenting cocked revolvers at his head said not a word you are our prisoner

permit me to get my hat gentlemen the doctor said cooly i will accompany you without protest

slipping a pair of nippers about his wrists they led him away to prison as the officers handed him over to the jailer the doctor said now that i am here you will be kind enough to inform me of the nature of my offense

you will find that out soon enough the officer addressed replied significantly your crime is not a killing one he said relenting a little as the jailor led the crestfallen young man away to his cell

as the doctor raised himself on his elbow and looked around he saw standing at the barred window across the room gazing for the last time upon the risng sun a man his face was black his features sharp his form symmetrical and the doctor noted as the man turned slowly toward him that his eyes flashed with a dangerous daring he also discerned that the stranger wore the badge and uniform of the grand army of the republic

good morning said lotus as the man slowly moved over toward him and sat down on the bed by his side

good morning doctor he replied i did not know i had such good company

it was harvey meeks he had been arrested a few hours before and surreptitiously incarcerated

you are about as much surprised to find me here as both of us are to find ourselves in such a predicament said the doctor huskily

your company is indeed an unlooked for sorrow but i have been expecting something of the sort since yesterday mr meeks calmly answerswered

i am in ignorance of my offense said the doctor of what have they accused you

defending a helpless child i suppose said mr meeks it was this way yesterday two boys one white the other black engaged in a youthful setto in front of my grocery a crowd was attracted before i went out to see what was the matter the black boy being the most hardy came off first best in the melee i stopped the fight and thought that would be the last of the trouble the crowd continued to hang about the store and in an hour or two had been largely augmented by a number of roughs i noticed the colored boy sitting in the store but busy with making out my bills tomorrow being pay day at the mill had entirely forgotten the incident when i was rudely awakened to the danger of the situation by hearing loud angry voices calling the boy to come out i went to the door tried to persuade the crowd to leave told them that it was only a boyish encounter and it was too trivial for men to pay any attention to i turned to go back into the store when one of the halfdrunken wretches called after me you are trying to shield the little nigger and you need a dressing down as well as the boy you are too saucy anyhow since you got into your new store harvey meeks i might say here that i noticed in the crowd a rival groceryman busily circulating among the men and from his air and frequent gestures knew that he was urging the excited men to loot my store to make a long story short the crowd seeing that they could not pick a quarrel with me avowed their intention to come in and take the boy out they made a rush for the door pushed in and advanced to take the child the little fellow ran to me and clinging to my coat skirts pleaded for protection i ordered the crowd back and when they continued to advance seized an axhandle from the counter and engaged with them several bullets whizzed past my head but in my anger i did not mind them i whipped out of my store the whole cowardly crew closed the door locked it and fled to the woods i went home last night hoping against hope that the matter would blow over as i left my house about four oclock to again seek a hiding place i was arrested i saved the child though he added proudly

lotus sat there for sometime holding the big manly fellows hand and in the tears that chased each other down the cheeks of both a sympathy which neither could have expressed in words sealed the tender compact of brotherly love so soon to be sundered by the hand of death

if the mob that fled before the strokes of that axhandle finds out that i am in this jail all the law in the state will not keep breath in my body twentyfour hours said mr meeks sadly

surely the authorities wil protect you said lotus reassuringly

the sheriff holds his office by the will of that mob i am a citizen and a soldier but belong to the class that can be maltreated with impunity we have no vote such a citizen is a non de script a waif a plaything at the mercy of every counter current in the sea of fate

do not look at it in such a funereal way while there is life there is hope replied dr stone if it ends as i feel it will and you escape death as i hope and pray you may he went on ignoring dr stones words of consolation make me one promise doctor i have a wife and son the woman can take care of herself see that the boy is sent north and educated

if i live said lotus i promise to carry out your wishes

i did you a service last night i saved miss underwood from the clutches of dr leighton i left him more dead than aliveâanother point in favor of my hanging he added

he related to lotus the incident with which the reader is already acquainted

dr leighton is at the bottom of my trouble said lotus he has been too friendly with me recently to pass without suspicion

dr stone was silent as he sat there thinking over the events of the previous night he wondered in his heart if ever again those scenes would be repeated the jailor came in with breakfast but neither of the prisoners had the appetite to touch it the day wore away as the scenes of night closed in upon them lotus noticed that his companion grew restlesshis step more quick and nervous the lines of his face tightened as the hours dragged their slow length along

at last as if impatient he turned to lotus with a look he will never forget and said it must be nearly midnight i have only a few hours to live

he knelt by the side of the iron couch and in a low but steady voice thanked god for the blessings of the past asked in childlike simplicity providential care of his soon to be widowed wife his voice trembled a little as he prayed for his boy lotus was not forgotten he prayed for him also and then as if all the hopes of his life had centred around him he pleaded again for heavens blessings and guidance for the child of his love then into thy hands father i commit my soul all my life i have trusted thee sustain me now

never before had lotus stone heard such a prayer if through the days of his college course a doubt of the realities of christianity had ever darkened his thoughts that prayer had driven that doubt away forever he rose from his knees with a look of triumph in his eyes

they are coming my hour is at hand he said resignedly his keen ears had detected the tramp tramp of approaching death long before lotus was aware of its insidious approach

this is the cell lotus heard someone say without there was a moment of deathlike stillness then the thud of a huge half of a telephone post told to the silent watchers within that the mob was at its work one tremendous thud and the huge hinges break from their fasteningsâthe door followed by the telephone post falls to the floor with a deafening crash they enter

rushing along the corridors their torches casting weird and ghostly shadows on the dingy walls of the prison they come at last to the cell where the two men are incarcerated

there he is someone cried a wild yell like the roar of a horde of hungry ferocious brutes greets this information lotus instinctively turned toward harvey meeks he stood there his arms folded his head erect the very personification of chivalrous manhood without fear and without reproach the door opening into the cell was battered down and the best citizens as the cowardly ruffians are called dragged harvey meeks from the prison to call this vile low born trash best citizens is to promulgate a libel upon decency that true southern manhood in the name of honor should refute

the mob moved along the street harvey meeks the rope already around his neck was pulled after them to the place of execution the bystanders hurled vile epithets at him as he passed and little boys wantonly stuck their knives into his quivering flesh several times as the blood from these numberless wounds ran into his shoes and spurting out marked the trail of the serpent to the bridge where he was to die did the victim piteously beg that he be killed outright

do not cut me up by inches kill me like a man he entreated

no heed was paid to his prayer save to increase the torture which he was receiving at the bridge the mob tightened the rope and then ordered him to get upon the rail and jump over

this he refused to do i will not kill myself he said

stand back said two stalwart fellows well throw the dâd old scoundrel over

they picked him up lifted him upon the railing and then shoved him over as he fell he caught hold of the side of the bridge let go they cried harvey like a drowning man clinging to a straw tightened his grip

here ill make him let go someone said and drawing out a long knife he reached down and cutting off the victims fingers one by one passed them to the jeering crowd as mementoes of the occasion

at last the dying man for want of fingers loosed his hold and dropped with a dull thud over the side of the bridge as his body writhed and twisted in the air a hundred revolvers more merciful than mans torture filled the swaying body full of holes putting the struggling soul beyond the reach of misery the blood of that martyred christian spilt by the relentless cruelty of white heathen ran red in the muddy waters of the eddying river the evidences of guilt were carried on to the father of waters the mississippi bore them to the restless ocean and the accusing winds gathered them into their friendly arms and wafted them up to the courts of heaven

not satisfied with his bloody deeds the man who cut off harvey meeks fingers returned with some of his companions and drawing the body up decapitated it attaching the rope under the arms of the corpse he swung the ghastly headless body over the bridge to hang there over sunday taking the head over to a neighboring saloon the crowd pushed through the glazed doors in high glee two of the men staggered up to the bar and stood there while one of them said give us three whiskies one for me one for jack and one he said as they lifted by the ears the amputated head to the counter for old harvey

dr leighton throwing his cigar from his fingers left the room he had seen enough for one night of the best families of grandville this spotted scion of a highly respected ancestry was the solitary representative

when the mob which murdered poor harvey meeks left the jail the night of the lynching lotus stone was so shocked at the fate of his friend that it never occurred to him to walk out of the open doors and make his escape for two hours the egress from his place of confinement was unguarded the sheriff the jailor and everybody else were having a two hours respite they had gone to see the hanging which if they had not aided openly in their hearts they had connived at the work the mob had so easily accomplished

in the early hours of the morning the jailor returned he visited the cell inhabited by dr stone and having satisfied himself that the prisoner had not taken french leave fastened up the main entrance as securely as he could and went to bed lotus stone did not sleep a wink that night whenever he closed his eyes he could hear the wild yells of the infuriated mob ringing in his ears and see the firm resigned face of harvey meeks calmly awaiting the worst

all through the weary hours of that long night he sat on his iron couch his head buried in his hands fearfully if impatiently awaiting the dawn of the narrow what a change a few hours can make in the life of a human being verily existence is as the days of a hireling life is but a tale that is told one short day and the selfadmitted happiest man in the world is as ready to confess that misery claims him for her own

when the first red rays of the rising sun fell through the iron lattice of the only window in the room dr lotus stone was hardly less unwilling to believe than had been his sad companion the morning before that perhaps it would never again rise in all its glory to shine for him one thought alone beat in upon the discouraged condition of lotus with the certainty of fate whatever the accusation against him regenia would never believe it true his faith in her love was an impregnable barrier against the dashing waves of despair let all the world be false regenia at least would be as true as gold it remains to be seen whether the faith which he believed on that morning to be as fixed as the eternal certitudes will be shaken by the trials awaiting him

there was a marked difference between the man that the officer led out to the preliminary trial and the one he brought to jail two evenings previous haggard his eyes sunken his face bristling with a beard of two days growth halting steps untidy in appearance the elegant dr stone staggered into the presence of the justice and took his seat on the prisoners bench the accusation was read and the hearing was begun lotus looked around for his accuser he was not left long in ignorance

abe johnsing whose acquaintance the reader has made in another chapter seated himself in the witnesses chair this indolent rascal who by a strange mischancehad broken his leginstead of his worthless neck brought suit for malpractice he told his story a web of wellwoven lies concocted of course by the chicanery of dr leighton abe johnsing would never have dreamed of prosecuting dr stone had not the blandishment of dr leighton excited his cupidity dr leighton knew that lotus stone had no money to pay damages but he persuaded abe johnsing that he had well knowing that with a few dollars in sight the ignorant loafer could be induced to swear away the life of his own sister abe johnsing was one of those traitorous afroamericans who for a few paltry dollars and the deceptive smiles of such as dr leighton would sell the fee simple of their souls salvation may their tribe wither and die under the righteous hate of all true men

dr leighton followed abe johnsing while professing the greatest esteem for dr stone candor and professional pride compelled him to make an unbiased statement of the case of abe johnsing as he found it

the justice stopped him the court he said has already heard testimony enough to hold the prisoner

dr stone asked to make a statement

it is entirely unnecessary was the reply you are bound over to court without bail take the prisoner back to jail he said to the officer bring on the next case lotus heard the unjust judge cry out as the officer led him back to his dingy cell

lotus was surprised the first day of his arrest that regenia did not come to condole with him in his misfortune but when two three four days and finaly a week had passed he settled down to the conclusion that regenia was no better than the other sunshine friends who had flitted about him in prosperity only to disappear when clouds arose

the grand jury sat a week after the preliminary hearing noted above a true bill was found an indictment alleged and dr lotus stone was ordered to appear in court and show cause why he should not be punished in consequence of malpractice inflicted upon abe johnsing it was evident to lotus after the rank partiality evinced at the first trial that he need not expect a shadow of justice from the stultified court of grandville he was given counsel as a matter of course but counsel without heart or sympathy injures rather than assists he had no witnesses not a friend showed his face to give comfort or offer assistance from the time of his incarceration to the day of his trial true he was not well known he was a man that made friends slowly he went to grandville to stayand therefore did not waste his time fawning upon the necks of half the city that thrift might follow fawning he wisely concluded that time and merit with close attention to his exacting profession would bring him both friends and success what friends he had were intimidated by the lynching of harvey meeks and consulting discretion left dr stone to his fate

the day for trial arrived the evidence was a repetition of that given in the preliminary hearing dr stones testimony in his own behalf would have convinced any unprejudiced jury of his innocence he clearly showed that against his admonitions abe johnsing had made his crooked leg more crooked by breaking it a second time in a drunken debauch

why weary the reader over the details of this onesided trial when the evidence was all in the judge to the surprise of everyone instructed the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty it need hardly be recorded that the jury followed the judges instructions

the next day sentence was passed when asked if he had anything to say in his own defense why sentence should not be passed dr stone arose there was a hush in the crowded court all eyes were turned toward the prisoner whose manly bearing excited admiration if his words could not change the intention of the court in a few clear well formed sentences lotus dissected the trumpedup evidence presented by the plaintiff and then turning to the judge he upbraided him for his rank unfairness as he proceeded to pour out a torrent of invectives the crowd began to cry out lynch him lynch him and pushing by the sheriff started toward lotus to carry out their intention

the judge and sheriff by dint of threats and admonition finally succeeded in mollifying the irate citizens sentence was pronounced and lotus stone was ordered to spend three years in the convict mines and to pay a fine of two hundred and fifty dollars he was accordingly ordered to be ready to start for the mines that night his horse buggy and other savings of a lifetime were seized to answer the demands of justice he waited and hoped till the last minute that regenia would come to say goodbye and strengthen his courage to bear up under the living death which he felt awaited him he looked in vain handcuffed he was marched off to the station only one soul in all that city showed him a single mark of kindness

as he neared a corner where a crowd jeered at him as he passed the little boy who was his patient the night he had first met regenia heedless of the guying bystanders pushed out and gave him a flower the tears flowed down his cheeks at this grateful remembrance of happier days when the train pulled out from the station the hapless doctor still held as if a most precious antidote the flower a fading reminder of lifes yesterday and today

where was regenia underwood that she thus neglected her friendâher avowed and accepted lover wild with delirium in the parsonage in irondale the shock she had received at the hands of dr leighton had left her unconscious for two days when consciousness returned brain fever set in and for weeks after lotus stone was an inmate of the convict camp she lingered between life and death when she finally began to convalesce her good nurses were put to their wits end to hide from her the facts of dr stones conviction she finally worried so over his failure to come and see her that the doctor feared that keeping the truth from her longer would be more deleterious than telling the whole story the knowledge that her lover had suffered so much and was still suffering and not a friend had been near to protest his innocence or cheer his sad heart to bear up misfortunes effected regenia deeply but her physician had timed so well his revelation and proceeded with so much tact that the evil effects feared were warded off

regenia wrote to clement st john as soon as she was strong enough and asked him to advise her what steps to pursue to have lotus pardoned

she did not begin work till after the christmas vacation her work no longer filled the nameless void which widened and deepened as the days went by with lotus a martyr to the machinations of doctor leighton life was robbed of half its charm her school of all its interest she grew listless her step lost its elasticity her eyes their sparkle her life its elixir the world said she was ill her work was too taxing and advised rest and change mother thomas could have told a different storyâa story of sleepless nights tearbedewed pillows and a heart slowly breaking with piteous sorrow for the man she loved

in the midst of a dense woods flanked on the east by a broken chain of lowlying hills stood a convict mining camp operated by a millionaire senator wined and dined as a social magnate in the capital of the nation here before man came to curse it with his cruelties nature exulted in surroundings the most picturesque and beautiful all day long the pure mountain stream gushing forth from a perennial spring in the solitudes of the forest pitched over miniature niagaras dodged and frisked between sharp upturned rocks grew thoughtful and sedate as it paused for a moment of recreation in the deep quiet waters shadowed by overhanging oaks and elms the morning sun as he chased the shadows of night from this sequestered bower surprised nature in a rude undress more entrancing than any clothing the facile pen or the artists brush can depict here unmolested the partridge built her nest the squirrel cracked nuts and saucily licked his paws while the timid deer lapped water from the laughing brook and lead through the devious pathways of the unbroken forest her browneyed young into this natural paradise like the serpent into eden came man he broke through the forest tunneled the mountains bridged and vitiated the stream killed the game and in place of the song of the bird and the murmur of the stream brought the whistle of the engine and the weird murmurs of sadness and despair on the banks of this stream in midwinter years before the beginning of our story about forty wretches handcuffed two and two with a chain passing through links on the chain that coupled them were driven from the railway to the spot where they were to form the nucleus of a convicts camp the neighboring hills were seamed with a vein of excellent coal and these men were brought to open and work in the new mines they built a cell house first and afterward a number of other outbuildings for the deposit of such stores as are needed about a mine

the cell house was built of logs it was a long low structure covered with brush without windows and having but a single door

in this the prisoners ate and slept two platforms one above the other gently sloping toward the centre of the building were erected on either side when the work of the day was over the prisoners men and women were driven into the cell house made to take the places assigned them and after eating required to lie down half way between the upper and lower platforms a chain was stretched fastening on the outside of the cell house this chain called the building chain passing through a link on the end of the waist chain of each of the convicts made escape almost impossible suspended from wires throughout the building were pine knots these when lighted gave to the strange scene within a grotesque appearance the front of the cell house was not fastened up as the other sides but between the logs were spacesacross which strips of wood were nailed perpendicularly through which the guard that stood without could always command an excellent view of the interior the building was surrounded by a palisade

the sanitary conditions of such a place necessarily beggars description the prisoners with scarcely clothing enough to cover their nakedness had no change until the clothes they wore fell apart by their own weight working in mud and water fifteen hours a day with scarcely food enough to keep soul and body from divorcement sleeping in an atmosphere thick with noxious exhalations fetid with filth and teeming with vermin death itself was a welcome relief nor was there any distinction of age or sex women and men boys and girls lived in this foul prison pen utterly regardless of the laws of morality

the guards under a condition where no one was responsible were cruel and vindictive no report was given nor was any required when a new batch of prisoners were driven in they changed their citizen clothes for the convicts stripes were numbered and immediately set to work each morning the convicts were awakened at four oclock treated to a breakfast of salt pork and corn bread hurriedly prepared and handcuffed in pairs a squad chain running through links in the chain that bound them together they were driven on a trot to the mines arriving at the mines they were separated into groups of ten or a dozen and hurried to the rooms or entries in which they were to work here from five oclock until eight they worked without respite not even stopping to eat the days work being done they were chained together as before and driven back to the cell house the guards were armed with muskets fitted with bayonets and if any poor wretch too weak and hungry to keep up chanced to fall he was prodded with the bayonet as the squad dragged him along the mortality was fearful hardly a mornings sun looked upon this scene once a delectable garden of the gods that did not behold a squad of trusties carrying some fortunate victim to his last resting place the dead were buried in long shallow trenches they were often piled one upon another it was no rare thing to see scattered about the woods a grinning skull or a bleaching shin bone disinterred by dogs or other domestic animals

there was scarcely any hospital arrangements in fact the haggard starved victims of this cruel system rarely ever had any use for a hospital a rude shanty covered with brush and filled with damp straw and vermin was appropriated to serve in that capacity an accident in the mines often brought this building into use but the convicts were worked until they were so near dead that death usually relieved them in the cellhouse it was no uncommon occurrence for a man to find when roused in the morning that he had been sleeping all night beside a corpse the prisoners for the most part were afroamericans

the question would naturally be asked if from a pecuniary standpoint alone it would not have been bettgr to treat these poor convicts more humanely the only object the lessee had was to get every hours work out of these men possible while breath was in their bodies the state was glad to dispose of the expense of keeping them whatever the consequence and it was frequently mooted among those who knew that whenever by reason of death hands were scarce at the mines agents trumped up petty accusations against able bodied negroes and secured long time sentences to the shame of justice in the convict mines more than one man has received a ten years sentence for stealing a chicken and that after the most shameful prostitution of every form of law

dr lotus stone had not arrived at the camp before he beheld a scene that made his blood run cold and served to prepare him for what he was soon to see so often as to scarcely occasion a passing notice when the squad of which he formed a part alighted from the train they were taken to the commissary department clothed in stripes and numbered on their way to the camp they came upon a man hanging by the thumbs the poor fellow had been there some time and writhed in mortal agony it is customary when administering this punishment after a short time to lower the culprit in this case the guard wishing to make an example of a troublesome disobedient convict left him hanging an hour or two beyond the usual time he ceased to move as the squad with which lotus came passed they cut him down soon afterâhe had received his last punishment his face seamed his muscles knotted with excruciating pain the haggard halfstarved wretch had passed through to that bourn from which no traveler ever returns

 as dr stone was numbered on the prison roll entered the cell house that day as a man condemned to die enter murderers row to await the day of execution he knew after glancing around the room that unless kind heaven or the crack of doom interposed he would never leave that place alive the attendants about the prison regarded every new man with suspicion he must be broken in as they express it

 was therefore put in the first couple the morning after arriving and when the gate of the palisade flew open led the squad on a run for the mines lotus stone had never before entered a coal mine he had no more notion of the work he was expected to do than a man reared in a balloon as he hurried down the incline that morning he resolved to do the best he could he would not give up to die as long as there was an ounce of active muscle unused in his body when the worst comes as it surely will i will sink out of sight without a complaint he said to himself

he had hardly worked all that long day in the mud under the constant drip from the black roof above him before hungry and tired he wished for death his roommate a tall rawboned man showed him every kindness taught him the art of bearing in and using the drill in a way not so expensive to nerve and sinew at the close of the first day stiff hungry and uncomfortable lotus dragged himself to the main entry and in the lead as before started on a trot for the camp he kept this up the first two or three hundred yards and then endurance could bear it no longer his head swam his muscles relaxed and he fell prostrate the men behind him stumbled over his prostrate form and the squad rolling over each other amid the prods from the guards bayonet and the terrible execrations on the head of the man who caused the accident the prisoners scrambled to their feet poor lotus tried in vain to rise but so weak was he from hunger and overwork that try as he might he could not get up the guard after kicking him and sticking his bayonet in the poor tired shoulders unfastened the squad chain and placing the first couple in the rear ordered the men forward in this manner poor lotus more dead than alive was dragged into camp shivering in every limb he stretched himself upon his hard bed too miserable and exhausted to attempt to eat

the next morning when ordered out he could not rise he attempted it but fell back in his place i know what you need said the guard you are one of them hightoned city niggers but ill take the shine out of you so saying he dragged lotus from the platform and taking him into the yard made him get down on his hands and knees stripping his shirt down he applied the rawhide to his back until the blood oozed out and ran to the ground in streams then washing the gaping wounds with salt and water he ordered him to rise and start on a trot for the mines

if lotus was too ill to go when first ordered to do so it would seem that after this he would have been utterly incapacitated but not so the human will when wrought upon by fear of death exercises a tremendous influence over the body after two or three desperate efforts lotus rose and although verily believing every step would be his last at the prod of the bayonet and the storm of abuse that followed him he staggered off to the mines he worked that day and for weeks afterward believing each night as he lay down on his hard bed that before the morrow death would come to his relief days rolled into months and still lotus bore up under the severe trials through which he was passing his only solace was his working mate often he would have given up or brooding over the injustice of his lot would have taken his own life but for the hope his partner no  breathed into his ear

at last one morning after no  had been in the camp about five months when ordered out he was unable to rise aching all over he tried in vain to sit up and go through the farce of dressing when breakfast had been served and the guard was going through a process called chain search no  was not in rank

with a muttered oath the guard went into the cellhouse and catching  by the collar snatched him down into the middle of the room you lazy devil he cried in towering rage get out there in your place or ill brain you

poor lotus tried to rise he pulled himself up by the assistance of the platform but when he attempted to walk staggered and fell into the guards arms kicking him off with an oath dont try your fits and starts on me you miserable nigger ill beat your face into a jelly so saying he struck lotus in the face felling him to the earth cant you see that man is sick said lotus partner

he had hardly got the question out of his mouth before the guard struck him down with a pine knot that lay on the floor get up you rascalânow open your mouth again and ill send you to hell

the man staggered to his feet the blood streaming from the wound the jagged pine knot had left

are you going he said turning to lotus or will i have to kill you to conquer your obstinacy i would go if i could indeed i would i cant stand up cant you see that i am sick have you no heart no pity

shut up your whining or youll be sicker than you are now before i get done with you

he called another guard to take the men to the mines then turning to lotus who still lay on the floor having tried time and again to sit up but try as he might each time mother earth would snatch him to her cold bosom said ill see if watering wont help you if you are sick a little washing out will do you good

lotus by this time was too sick to know or care what became of him the man soon returned with a wooden pail filled with water he lifted lotus up and sat him against the platform open your mouth he said

lotus mechanicaly obeyed he then began that most cruel of all the punishments practiced by the spanish inquisition pouring water down a victims throat through a funnel until the stomach distends and pushing up against the heart and other vital organs produces a pain not less severe than death itself this the villainous guard continued until the head of the tortured man fell over his arms relaxed then became rigid and the pallor on lotus face made him remove the funnel and drop the cup with fright rolling the poor fellow over on his face the guard in his excitement did unwittingly the only thing that could have saved his victim the water spurted out of his mouth in a stream and after some time lotus opened his eyes

where am i he said oh clement my boy i knew you would come to see me

the guard lifted the slender body back on the platform and with the wild talk of lotus ringing in his ears left him to his fate by night lotus was raging with an attack of fever the guard conscious that his last punishment had hastened the attack begged the captain to have the man placed in the hospital the request was granted here lotus was carried and all night and for many nights afterward his life hung on the turning of a hair to the guard who in his ignorance and meanness had treated lotus so illy is due the fact that he finally recovered his chain partner was allowed to sleep at the hospital and administer what comfort his presence would afford hospital men were usually allowed more privileges than those in the cell house the habitues of the hospital were as i have said before men who had been severely injured in the mines and could not as a general thing have escaped if opportunity offered

when lotus had been in the hospital about three weeks and was beginning to sit up a little every day his partner was brought in one night when the squad returned dangerously injured

two events which occurred on the night that  was injured served to make the day memorial the escape of two convicts and the wounding of the guards that attempted their capture  was buried under a fall of slate about noon and although his sad plight was discovered soon after the accident no effort was made to ascertain his condition until late in the afternoon when he was finally extricated from the living death he had been enduring for hours he was simply laid upon a slack pile until the men after the hour work ceased would have time to carry him out

he lay there suffering inexpressible pain until nearly eight oclock at that hour a squad of men placed his broken body on a board in which plight he was conveyed to the main entry arriving there he was placed upon a car of loaded coal and driven to the shaft and hoisted to the surface

the men went up the incline climbed the steps to the tipple and placing the body upon a skid two squads of them bearing the skid with their free hands thus conveyed it to the camp

as the men entered the tipple it was observed that there were ten men in one squad and only six in the other in order that the number in each might be the same the guard released two of them from the larger squad and essayed to attach them to the smaller in doing this he thoughtlessly set his gun against the wall

the two men released jumped between the guard and the gun opened the tipple door rushed down the steps and slunk away in the darkness the guard fired several shots in the direction he thought they had taken and hastened to camp to make the affair known the bloodhounds were released and taken to the tipple where they were put upon the trail of the men

the men in the meantime had secured a good lead making straight for the welsh mining camp a few miles across the hills by the help of the hounds the guards tracked them to their place of concealment and demanded their surrender the men had gone to the principal loafing place in the little town and poured their tale of suffering into the ears of sympathetic listeners they had related the story of s accident and the criminal neglect which had followed the unusual and cruel methods of punishment practiced by the heartless guards the long hours of labor the starvation rations they stripped off their shirts and displayed the scars which the bayonets had left they ended all by begging if it was the intention to again deliver them to the clutches of these fiends incarnate to season justice with mercy and kill them on the spot they said they had no idea that escape was possible for even now the blood hounds were baying upon their tracks but hoping that the world might be enlightened upon the condition of the poor helpless victims whose case was worse than death they had tempted fate and came forth to give to the world some idea of their condition

the miners were touched by their storyâwho with hearts would not have been hiding the convicts they secreted themselves and awaited results in due time the blood hounds closely followed by their attendants tracked the convicts to their lair the miners shot the dogs and after overpowering the guards beat them severely and sent them back to camp there was not an honest heart in the entire vicinity of that convict mine that did not throb with pentup hatred toward it

the stories of heartlessness which found their way to the homes of the people living near the camp engendered a hatred for those who conducted it more deeply seated than the proverbial dislike of his satanic majesty for disinterested goodness the miners had many additional reasons for hating the system as well as the men first it degraded labor by coming into competition with it second the convicts fill places that were the just due of free labor third convict coal could be put on the market cheaper than that dug by free labor and hence the owners of mines operated by convicts regulated the wages of those conducted by them fourth a deep seated hatred native in the human heart against systematic cruelty

from the above observations the reader will gather the causes that led up to the events which follow

the assaulted guards went back to the camp and spread the news of their adventure and after consultation the captain with a dozen guards on horseback and armed capapie rode over to the mining town

while they are riding over to the welsh town let us go back to the hospital and look upon the scene transpiring there the evening  was brought in crushed beyond recognition lotus had sat up a short time he had taken his milk which constituted his diet since he had been able to eat anything and dozed off in a restless sleep when he was awakened by the men bringing in his old partner they deposited the poor fellow on the straw and were marched off to the cell house

lotus called a guard to him and asked may i not try to dress his wounds

you would better attend to your own ills said the guard laughing

no but i am a doctor and perhaps said lotus with an invisible blush i can relieve the poor fellow

you can give me instructions said the guard ill do it

the face of the injured man is washed splints are secured and under lotus instructions the bones are set and bandaged and  made as comfortable as possible for the night

the old man did not regain consciousness until about the turn of the night about this time lotus thought he heard someone speak and raising himself on his elbow he listened then he heard ninetynine where are you ninetynine

here i am said lotus crawling over to him he motioned to his parched lips lotus called the guard and asked him to bring  a drink of water the guard complied

after he had moistened his lips he said ninetynine i have but a short time to live and i am glad of it i dreamed of you just now youll live to get out of this place dont lose heart he said huskily

lotus moistened his lips and said what did you dream

my dreams always come trueâyoull live to get out of here and the knowledge of that fact makes death a happy release

how long have you been here said lotus he had never asked  even his name fearing that reference to his past might call up unpleasant reminiscences lotus had purposely refrained from asking the old man anything about himself ten years as nearly as i can reckon it he said with a far away look in his eyes as if trying to bridge the awful space of ten years in a convict mine

my life has been a hard one he continued without further questioning i lived the slave to a cruel master until after the war when i became my own master the first thing i did was to get married i worked on the farm year after year sometimes coming out a little behind at the end of the year and at rare periods coming out a little ahead we had no children we never cared much whether we had money or not we tried to lay up our riches he said raising his eyes impressively heavenward where moth and rust does not corrupt nor thieves break through and steal

what a wealth of faith these old people have and how they apply what few passages of holy writ they know to the salvage of every wound of life thought lotus as he moistened the old mans lips again breathing with difficulty he continued the last year me and the old woman spent together after the years crop was gathered and sold the boss figured us in debt to him i ventured to protest when he drove us away from the place on our way to find a new patch for the next year we passed by a field where cabbage had been growing we had some bacon and bread and stopped in a fence corner to cook our dinner the field had been reaped standing in the field i saw a collard which was not considered worth cutting up when the cabbage had been cut i went over and pulled it up and boiling it with my little piece of bacon it served to help our dinner greatly this was my undoing we were arrested for stealing and i was sent up for fifteen yearsâshe for ten as my accomplice she died of a broken heart a few months after her arrival she could not endure this place i used to wish i could die i finally settled down to trust in god and stay until he called me

seeing the tears in lotus eyes he said dont cry ninetynine fortyseven will soon be better off

his voice grew weaker and lotus could see what an effort it was for him to talk dont try to talk said lotus

take my hand take my hand ninetyâninety ânineâthe pine knot is growing dim it is nearly day

for a long time lotus lay there holding the lean hand in his and now and then exploring the wrist for the pulse about four oclock lotus heard him say night is breaking the day is dawningâ then raising himself up in bed he lifted his hands heavenward exclaiming im coming nowâim coming now and falling back on his couch of straw the eyes of  closed on the sights of this world may we hope that he saw in the beckoning distance angels awaiting him in a heavenly rest

as he expired a gust of wind blew out the pine knot that had flickered and glared all night over the couch of the dying the clouds rolled back and through the broken roof a flood of moonlight fell on the bed of the dead man shrouding it in a sheen of silver

lotus was roused from the reverie which the circumstance produced by hearing gun shot after gunshot and the far away sound of galloping horses hastily approaching the camp

the trip made by the captain of the convict mines and his troop of horsemen to welshtown proved to be an event pregnant with thrilling experiences the air of conscious superiority which the company had worn when riding away from the camp was changed to the crestfallen look of the vanquished before it returned the arm of the law was not only challenged but an appeal was made to the higher if unwritten statute which makes right more potent than might the captain and his guard rode through the little mining town with all the haughty hilarity of a victorious army entering a conquered city when they approached the house where the two convicts were supposed to be in hiding their progress was somewhat impeded the entire male population of the usually quiet little place had sallied forth from their homes and assembled about the point of disturbance

the captain nothing daunted drew rein before the house and demanded the surrender of the convicts

they are not here said one of the convicts and if they were wed see you in hell before wed send them back to the charnelhouse you keep down there in which to beat and starve men to death

they are our prisoners put into our hands by the authority of the state and welshtown has widened its corporate limits considerably if it is bigger than the whole state said the captain cooly

we do not give a continental who put them into your care a wolf couldnt be more gentle with a lamb than you are with your charge the miner replied

if they are in that house we expect to have them the law sanctions our right and i call upon all good citizens to assist me in the prosecution of my duty said the captain dismounting

there is a higher lawâa law that existed previous to the legislature that legalized this damnable tool of cheap labor we refuse by the law of common humanity by the statutes of self preservation to allow these men to the detriment of our wives and children to longer compete with us in the struggle for existence if we had no hearts if our sympathies did not go out to the poor illtreated halfstarved wretches an enlightened self interest would no longer permit oppressive capitalists to use these victims of a misdirected and ruinous state economy to glut the markets with their cheapproductto the injury of free labor this convict system is a piece of shortsighted retrenchment it may be a saving to the state but it means poor work at starvation wages for the miners hear hear cried the men crowding about their leader

you have those men in there and we intend to bring them out said the captain i know nothing about the policy of the state and less about the condition of the miners my duty is plain those men have been sent to me by the proper authorities your quarrel is with them until some other arrangement is made to support the men under my charge i shall continue to work them in the mines give them up peaceably and settle your dispute about prices with someone that has use for your labor

you had better come and take them cried a miner

that is just what i intend to doâpeaceably if i can forcibly if i must replied the captain firmly

as he said this he gave the reins of his horse to one of the guards and approached the fence the guards quickly brought their horses into line and detaching their winchesters prepared to attack the crowd as the captain advanced he was ordered to halt but fearlessly disregarded the command

halt i say rang out on the still mountain air if you advance another step ill shoot you dead

the guard hearing this awaited no further orders but commenced firing into the crowd the miners were at first disconcerted but rallying returned the fire from the shelter of the house wellframe and windows two of the guards were shot

the captain discerning that they were outnumbered ten to one hastened to his horse mounted and ordered a retreat the miners fired a volley after them and then a company of the bravest sallied forth in pursuit the horses being obliged to keep to the roads the miners by short cuts over the hills were able now and then to come in range of the flying guards and pour into them a deadly fire thus they followed them into camp

flushed with the success of their easy victory the pursuers did not halt until they had crossed the creek and attacked the convict camp for awhile the guards were able to check the impetus of their antagonists but the miners dividing their forces began to pour in upon the beleagured camp a destructive crossfire which sent the defenders in hasty retreat leaving the camp and the convicts in the hands of the triumphant mountaineers

they proceeded to despoil the camp they broke open the palisade gate made a prisoner of the now thoroughly scared custodian at the door of the cellhouse and walked into the presence of the convicts they unfastened the building chain and freeing the captives ordered them to take to their heels if they valued their liberty the prisoners needed no second invitation the convicts having vacated the cellhouse the enraged miners set fire to it they broke into the commissary destroyed the stores and threw the clothing and other supplies about the building not thoroughly satisfied with their work they went over to the mines and completed the destruction the tipple was fired the mine flooded the air chamber closed and hundreds of empty coal cars piled up and made a bonfire of they did not disturb the hospital when they had fully satisfied the pentup hatred which years had engendered toward this foul blot on the fair name of the state they marched to the top of the hill and turning looked back upon the scene of their late victory their leader lifted his cap and said give three cheers for the capture of camp hell fire

the men obeyed orders with three rousing cheers and a tiger long before the victors got back to their homes the gray dawn had gathered about her the skirts of night and the east had changed her robe of blue dotted with stars for the rosy hue of coming morn

the captain and his vanquished guard had ridden on to the telegraph station beyond the convict camp and dispatched to the governor for troops to uphold the arm of the law

on the very morning that the bulletin boards were telling the story of the assault upon the convict mines clement st john was walking up from the station at grandville having just arrived from minton he saw the crowds gathered about the corner upon which the western union telegraph office was located and curiosity impelled him to cross over and ascertain the cause of excitement

he eagerly read the newsâperhaps lotus has escaped he said half audibly if he has he will probably need some assistance to stay escaped he mused laughingly

he set down his traveling bag took a card from his vest pocket tore it into as many tiny pieces as possible then as if satisfied that with the tools at hand the card could not be further divided he flung the pieces into the street and picking up his carpet bag retraced his steps to the station

its risky business he said to himself but lotus would chance it for me

the first train was leaving for the convict camp when he rushed out and mounted the last coach he had just time enough to leave his satchel in the baggage room get a ticket and catch the train clement st john more to please regenia than to demonstrate any faith he had in its ultimate success came to grandville to try and secure a pardon for lotus the injustice exhibited at the trial the severe sentence for such an offense both argued eloquently against the hope of seeing his friend the recipient of executive clemency nevertheless at the continued beseeching of regenia and the urgent wish of his wife who ceased not day nor night since first hearing of dr stones sentence to insist that something should be done what that something was she never explained but the burden of her song was cant something be done

clement knowing how powerless he was to change the course of the law was made to feel that he had lost interest in his old friend by the constant contentions of lucile that something should be done he had at last concluded if he valued his peace of mind he would better do something or pretend to do something either case lie hoped would serve to satisfy his wife of the futility of his attempt

he arrived at what a few hours before had been the camp about noon he walked in and out through the smoldering embers and felt that he had come on a fools errand he came by accident up to the door of the hospital he thought he heard some one groan he took a step forward and looked again he discovered the outline of a human being wrapped in a dirty blanket but motionless

what have we here pray he said approaching the bundle and pushing away the straw from the halfburied form

a dead man he exclaimed starting back then seeing another form covered entirely with straw great caesar this must be a dead house he said so loud that one of the figures heard the noise and stirred

now clement st john was anything but a superstitious man but the straw shaking over what to all appearances was a corpse filled him with an uncanny feeling at least akin to fear the straw shook again this time more pronounced than the first clement throwing his fears to the wind went over to the figure and clearing away the straw saw it was a man

the supposed dead man sat up rubbed his eyes and looked at clement for a long time observing the eyes of the sick man fill with tears clement asked whats the matter are you wounded

yes said the man

where asked clement kneeling by his side

here he replied placing his thin hand over his heart

as he spoke the last time clement raised his eyes my god lotus is it you

dont you know me have i changed so much

clement could say no more he grasped the almost transparent hand of his friend and shocked almost beyond the power of utterance sat down beside him on the heap of straw

have i changed so much said lotus breaking the silence

have you changed thought clement even your voice is not the same

not so much he said but i was so dumbfounded at seeing what i supposed to be a dead man come to life that it dazed me

worn to a shadow through sickness and constant labor covered with filth and grime until his color and features were undiscernable his hair uncombed a shaggy beard covering his face who that knew the elegant dr stone a few months ago could have recognized in the dim light of that log pen the man who masqueraded as his shadow

what brings you here said lotus

i came to help you to escape said clement get up and come away

as clement essayed to rise he put his hand out to assist himself it fell upon the cold face of a dead man and he recoiled with a shiver

dont they bury their dead here asked clement

he died last night said lotus and there has been nobody here since the welshtown miners assaulted the camp last night and everybody but me has taken french leave

you must go immediately what on earth are you hanging on to said clement as lotus shook his head

i am hanging on to life i am just recovering from the fever and could not walk a step if i were to be pardoned for it he replied

well ill have to carry you for i do not intend to leave this place without you so you might as well dress and mount my back

i have nothing to dress in but stripes and you would not get very far with your loadbefore some officer would capture us then the mines would have two convicts instead pf one i cannot allow you to do that my friend you have a wife i have no oneâ he said dropping his voiceâit dont matter so much about me

ill soon get clothes enough said clement leaving lotus staring after him as he hurriedly quit the room

he returned shortly with the very suit of clothes lotus had worn when he came to the mines

here we are he said cheerfully ill put you back in your old suit

he had hardly commenced to dress lotus when looking up he saw a guard standing in the door his musket leveled at him

what are you doing there asked the guard

dont you see said clement with cool assurance i am trying to make this sick man a little more comfortable

what are you taking those stripes off for asked the guard

i think these will look better and besides the old ones are filthy

who are you said the guard

only the governors private secretary said clement continuing to dress lotus

the gun dropped and the guard came forward offering his assistance

the soldiers and perhaps thousands of citizens will be down on that next train and it will be as well for all of us that this single sick man looks as if we were not as black as we are painted

you go and get some water and wash this man up a bit if the governors secretary is not afraid of him i guess he wont bite you when you have done that get some clean straw or a cot if you have one and put this man on it have this dead man buried he continued as the guard started for the water clement cried after him where is the captain the guard answered and went on a trot for the water

clement had taken care to keep his head down and profit by the darkness of the place as soon as the guard left clement said to lotus i must leave you but ill be back and take you north with me or die in the attempt

tell the guard i have gone out to see the captain and will be in again shortly i expect the governor himself will be down with the soldiers

as he walked rapidly through the woods to the station true to the newsgatherers instinct it occurred to him that being first on the ground he might make a scoop and add a turn of business to his little adventure he stopped in the dense forest donned a black wig to cover his red stiff hair drew a pair of nose glasses from his pocket and adjusted them then hurried on toward the station on his way he met a guard coming in with a convict he hailed him represented himself to be a correspondent for a well known administration paper and stated his mission to be to get a correct report of the affair before it was misconstrued by the opposition papers producing his notebook he rapidly noted the guards explanation of the affair he thanked him and walked on to the station

arriving there he learned that it would be two hours before train time he concluded to walk over to welshtown and board the train for grandville at that place fortune favored him he chanced to meet up with a countryman jogging along in a wagon from whom he got a lift to welshtown at welshtown he succeeded in getting an account of the affair from the other side

he went to a hotel and wrote up the matter in his excellent report he deftly worked a description of the solitary convict pictured him as stating that having been unjustly imprisoned he refused to go away with the rest and thus be hunted up and down the earth never free from the ghost of the convict mines he incidentally hinted that the case ought to be looked into evidently he added the case appeared to be one for executive clemency he reviewed the case of dr stone spoke of him as being a victim to the insatiate hate of abe johnsing whose character alone ought to belie his sworn allegation

boarding the afternoon train he took advantage of a thirtyminute stop at the only place where his article could be put on the wires and sent the message to the evening papers at grandville he met six companies of militia about  miles from grandville enroute to the supposed scene of the disturbance

on every corner as he walked toward the parsonage in irondale he heard the newsboys crying latest news from the convict mines

by the smoldering wood fire the evening paper having fallen from her slender hands her eyes closed her head resting on the back of the big arm chair sits regenia underwood thinking of the past she has just finished reading clement st johns stirring report of the events at the mines through all the long weary months which have elapsed since lotus was snatched away he has been the center of her thoughts by day the object of her prayers by night she is recalling a moonlit night in the long ago reflecting upon the loving words remembered now with a thrill of passionate sadness how vividly the picture comes back how she hears over and over again the pathetic refrain will you forget perchance regret the nights ambrosial days of idle dreaming the songs we sung when love was young and earth a paradise was seeming

she had striven to forget the song but tonight thoughts of the past rise unbidden like a dream and through the dreary isolation of her starved and broken heart ring anew in a minor chord of sadness can i forget she murmurs through her tears how can i forget the nights ambrosial days of idle dreaming

she covered her face with her hands while sob after sob resounded through the quiet room

mrs thomas had come in and sat down by her side bringing that comfort she knew so well how to administer while the two women sat there holding each others hands someone opened the gate the steps approached the door regenia was thinking of lotus mrs thomas was wondering when simon had left the house there was a ring mrs thomas busied herself making a light another ring this time a little louder than before

regenia after drying her eyes on her apron opened the door it was clement st john

well miss underwood are you not glad to see me

regenia was disappointed she was hoping it was lotus being thus addressed she made haste to give clement a hearty welcome

you know how glad i am to see you and lucile is she well

quite well when i left home i have not heard from her since my arrival

of course not said regenia smiling how long have you been here

i came this morning he answered

and have you been all this time finding us she asked with evident surprise

no i have been down to find lotus he said carelessly

how is he is the report in the paper true have you read it here it is she said in a breath

no i have not read it he said with a quizzical smile

she handed him the paper pointing out the glaring head lines

i do not care to read any fake newspaper report he said waving the paper away

do read it she said it is so kind to myâ she colored violentlyâto dr stone she added

some other time he said laughing then noting the tears gathering in her eyes he said there dear dont look like that i do not care to read my own scribbling i wrote the account

you dear good clement she said calling him by his first name how lucile must love you getting up from her chair she walked over to the big kindhearted redheaded homely fellow and gave him a kiss

thats from lucile she said

i accept it for the doctor he replied laughingly if i had known such pay was awaiting me at this end of my journey  i would have doubled the length of my article with the hope of receiving double pay he said with a knowing look at mrs thomas

by this time rev simon thomas who had been in the library making final preparations for his sunday sermon came into the room he was introduced to clement whom both he and his wife felt they already knew from hearing regenia speak of him so frequently

the trio gathered about mr st john and listened with breathless interest while he related the experiences of the day he touched lightly upon the condition of dr stone softened into a minimum the sufferings and deprivations through which lotus had passed and ended with a glowing description of the heroic fortitude exhibited by lotus in bearing uncomplainingly his unjust sentence

regenias eyes expressed the thanks she could not find words to express your account in the paper is very different from the version you give to us she said fearing that mr st john had been more influenced by what his auditors wished to hear than by a strict adherence to the actual facts

i plead guilty to the soft impeachment said clement his faceassuming a questionable smile but the first account was to influence the public the second he added laughingly is for private consumption only i was in duty bound to present the affair in the way best calculated to forward the ends i wished to attainâthe delivery of my friend from the unjust imprisonment he is undergoing that may not be in keeping with your code of morals reverend he said glancing at mr thomas and vainly trying to ascertain that gentlemans opinion of the course pursued but this is one of the cases where the ends justify the means in his heart he was thinking what a dilemma i have got into by my twice told tale and neither of them will stand the test of the ten commandments

do you think there is any hope of dr stone being pardoned asked mrs thomas

you angel thought clement anything is better than a continuance of the explanation of why i told two tales he said that depends upon how much influence we can bring to bear upon the governor if we strike the iron while it is hot i have every reason to believe we can secure his release

the account in the paper ought to awaken an interest in his favor mr thomas answered

clement had no wish to revert to the paper or anything it contained having got safely away from that subject he was determined to give it a wide berth the rest of the evening

if we can get the signatures of some of your influential citizens and bring their prestige to bear upon the governor we may succeed beyond our expectations i have been thinking we might see what we can do tomorrow said clement looking at regenia

why not go tonight she said if his pardon depends upon our energy i am ready to begin work now i do not think i shall sleep a wink tonight anyway and lying awake idle will be such a loss of time she added unable to suppress her excitement

not tonight said clement kindly tomorrow will be early enough go to sleep and get all the rest you can it will stand you in excellent need during the work of the next few days

it was decided that the next day regenia accompanied by mr thomas and clement should take the initiatory steps toward securing a pardon for dr stone

when the sun rose the next morning and fell in golden beams through the halfopen shutters of regenia underwoods room it disclosed the anxious girl sitting by the window her chin resting on her hand impatiently awaiting the hour to begin her work she had not been to bed unmindful of clements admonition she knew that there could be no sleep for her eyes until at least an effort had been made to bring her lover back to her side mr thomas too was up by times indeed an air of restlessness pervaded the whole house

breakfast over the three friends started upon their mission fraught with so much interest to the sick convict fretting his life away at the mines the prosecuting attorney was first visited and his name secured to head the paper then followed the manager of the steel plant and before the day was done a long list of signatures representing the solid citizens of grandville were added to the paper indeed few could listen to the sad story so touchingly related by the attenuated petitioner and withhold their signatures rev simon thomas was also a tower of strength he had numberless friends among the best people of grandville as what upright afroamerican has not the men who signed the petition were not politicians they had long since become disgusted with the methods pursued by this gentry and withdrew from their blighting influence such men are the real leaven of the state their names attached to a paper gave it the weight of a worthy cause

the next day the petition was carried to the governor he listened with interest to regenias story and taking the petition glanced down the list podding his head as some name of particular interest met his eyes calling regenia to him when he had gone over the list he said kindly your matter shall have my attention at the very earliest convenience

regenia thanked him kindly and the three bowed themselves out of the great mans presence

the worry and loss of sleep consequent upon regenias anxiety left her in a very debilitated state clement insisted her doctor joining him in the opinion that regenia should resign her work and go home he wished to have her leave grandville before the issue of the petition was disclosed he believed whether the issue was favorable or otherwise it would be alike injurious to regenia day after day she searched the papers for notice of the governors action upon the cause nearest her heart when a week had passed away and nothing had been done she began to evince symptoms of the return of her old malady

one day nearly a week after the petition had been presented clement came to the parsonage with word from the governor that action would be taken the next day before telling regenia however he read to her a letter from his wife bemoaning the loneliness of her state and beseeching regenia to come home and keep her company clement seeing he had touched a tender chord in regenias nature put on the wind harp stop and in half suppressed tones eloquently supplemented his wifes request regenia was convinced and accordingly the next day left for minton

as the train left the depot clement called after her i will be homesoon and bring the doctor with me

the day following he left for the mines bearing the governors permit to remove lotus to a neighboring house and attend him until he was well enough to move he did not grant the pardon but clement considered this a good omen

armed with the governors permit the morning after regenia left for minton clement bade farewell to his kind friends at the parsonage and made his way a second time to the convict mines his arrival was indeed opportune lotus grown restless on account of the constant tumult kept up by the drunken citizen soldiers had given away to a fretful impatience that had materially lessened his chances of recovery otherwise his condition was decidedly improved the filthy straw in which clement found him immured on the occasion of his first visit had given way to a neat cleancot and the dingy walls whose dampness had emitted a stifling stench were brightened and sweetened by a coat of whitewash clement noted with satisfaction that the orders of the self appointed governors private secretary had been obeyed with a startling celerity clement knew that the first step necessary to his friends complete convalescence was to get him away from the din of that camp once away from the memories of his condition recovery would be only a matter of time

as soon as he had arrived in the camp and made his presence known to lotus he repaired to the captain and presented the permit for the removal of dr stone the captain consented readily his inhuman treatment of the convicts had lately received such a notorious airing that he was glad of an opportunity to show his clemency he was under the watchful eye of the omnipresent press and knew full well that any lack of courtesy would be sent on the snowy wings of the morning news to every village and hamlet in the country

accordingly clement hastened to a farm house near the camp and arranged with its afroamerican tenant to bring his friend there with the help of an ambulance lotus was conveyed to his new abode with little discomfort the house and its location were all that could have been desired a two story building made of hewed logs and smooth floors strangers alike to dirt and carpets lotus was domesticated in a large airy room up stairs the first thing clement did after seeing his friend comfortably situated was to send to town for a box of books and arrange to have the daily papers thrown from the cars at a point near the house

here perched in a big oldfashioned splitbottom chair you might have seen him day after day reading to lotus preparing his medicine or relating some droll story or incident calculated to interest or amuse the patient under such favorable circumstances and in the hands of such a nurse it would have been strange if the improvement of the patient had not been marked clement had not been at the farm a week before he received a letter from his wife informing him of regenias arrival and the shocking condition of her health the doctor had advised a trip to the sea shore and insisted upon her accompanying regenia clement sat down and wrote to his wife to go by all means he said nothing to lotus about this letter he did not wish his friends nerves disturbed by any additional foreboding

in a week lotus was so far recovered as to be able to sit up for hours each day clement was growing restless with anxiety at the delay of the pardon he had kept his fears to himself however but lotus could see that something was wrong

on one thing clement st john had decided lotus stone should never return to that convict camp he would take him from the fires of that slow consuming hell or lose his life in the attempt

about two weeks after clement left grandville the longexpected pardon came clement ran every step of the way from the station to the farm house he burst in upon the astonished farmer and his wife waving the precious paper over his head it has come at last he exclaimed as soon as he could get breath enough to force the words through his lips

whats the matter down there a weak voice cried from the room above

clement cleared the steps three at a bound and rushing into the room the big fellow nearly smothered lotus in the mad exuberance of his expressions of joy he took the emaciated doctor in his arms and pointing to the pardon in his hand wept with uncontrolled joy his feelings bad been strung to such a high pitch in the weeks and weeks of hoping and waiting that when the object of his labor had culminated successfully he could not refrain from weeping

dr stone wept with his friend men weeping

yes under the circumstances who will say that in the expresshion of such joy as they felt it was unmanly to give vent to it in any way

all that day the two friends talked over plans  for the future lotus was first inclined to go back to grandville and take up his work where he had so suddenly left off clement discouraged this he had his reasons but he wisely refrained from expressing them

as soon as you are well enough said clement well go over to the mines and bid farewell to the scenes which will no doubt linger with you all through life

no thank you said lotus i think i have had those scenes engraved upon the tablets of my memory indelibly i never want to look in that direction again if i can help it

now that you are free from its terrors i would fancy you possessed with a morbid curiosity to study the subject from a different point of view said clement

i have gone through an experience in the past six months my friend from the effects of which i doubt that i shall ever thoroughly be free the world has no conception of the suffering attending the poor unfortunates driven to death in those mines i have seen sights and experienced degrees of depravity that beggars my vocabulary to describe i believe in total depravity the men who goad whip and starve the helpless wretches under them in that earthly hell are totally depraved

yet it is the law it is so nominated in the bond said clement

i have read the lucid descriptions of george kennan said lotus slowly i have studied the tortures of the spanish inquisition but i unhesitatingly declare that the convict lease system as practiced in our own land is the most cruel heartless and tyrannical the world has ever seen

every system of punishment contemplates however remotely the reformation of the culprit this reckons only upon his death how many more days can he stand before it kills him enters into the cool calculation of those who perpetrate this villainous system

the system has received a breath of air from without in the last few days and i think the flood of light that will fall through the rent already made will be sufficient to institute an inquiry that must result in good replied clement

i signed a petition once circulated among the students at college praying the czar of all the russians to take steps for the amelioration of the condition of his prisoners in the convict mines of siberia how often since as i rolled on the hard boards laden with chains in the cellhouse at the mines have i contemplated the grim irony of that petition physician heal thyself we could give russia points on convict tyranny her lictors never dreamed of ah he said as if weary of the subject i have always been a conservative believer in the final triumph of liberty an intense sympathizer with the oppressed of every land when autocratic russia confines in siberias dreary mines her noblest hearts my heart in sorrow pities them when haughty britain grinds beneath her iron heel the evicted tenants of conquered but not subjugated ireland i feel with them the iron enter my own soul but when america our own native godblessed land enters the list of oppressors and confines men in a hell more torturing than siberia more despotic than turkey more cruel than the grave i weep for the sad degeneration of my own countrymen

clement observing that his patient was growing more and more dispirited as his mind contemplated the scope of his wrongs sought to divert the course of his thoughts by changing the conversation i have a letter to answer he said and as lotus seemed indifferent to the implied question he continued why do you not ask to whom i am about to indite my epistle

you write so much that another letter more or less scarcely excites any special interest lotus replied

well i am going to write to lucile shall i send her your love

just as much of it as you can get inside of an envelope replied lotus

she is at breeze nook spending a few months he explained

at breeze nook by the sad sad sea what could have taken her so far from home asked lotus in some surprise

she went with miss underwood clement answered carelessly at the same time narrowly observing the effect the information would have upon his friend

lotus was visibly affected at every mention of regenias name he made no reply but clement discerned his color change and his face twitch in spite of his efforts at selfcontrol from considerations best known to himself clement had not told lotus the part regenia had played in securing executive clemency for him nor had he related how the young woman had day after day worn away to a shadow in sympathy with her lover

dr stone still believed her cold and unsympathizing the fact that she was off to the seaside forgetful of his sorrows confirmed him in the belief that she was entirely heartless he was too proud to make a single inquiry of the cause of her leaving the south and clement decided that having opened the way to induce his friend to talk of the subject nearest to his heart he must either show a desire for more knowledge or wait until circumstances pushed him in the right direction circumstances might kindly direct him in the right direction but it is certain lotus could not be led to evince an interest in one he thought lost to every proper womanly feeling

clement had not lost anything by his trip south he had filled his paper the events with the freshest news from the seat of disturbance while at the same time he had kept a glowing column of special correspondence in several daily papers which had made his stay very remunerative

shortly after the pardon came clement concluded that his patient was so far advanced in the path of health that it would not be unsafe to remove him about a month after his first visit he turned his back on the convict mines forever the threatened trouble had cleared away the soldiers after costing the state a large sum had returned and as most of the escaped convicts had been recaptured the camp with a few outward reforms had dropped into its accustomed routine the convict lease system however had been given a blow from which it would not soon recover the illumination it had received had served to array against it a class of agitators who it is hoped in time will erase the foul blot from the escutcheon of civilization

rev simon thomas and his wife gave a royal welcome to lotus on his return from the mines many of his sunshine friends who had hid behind the clouds in the day of his trouble fell over each other in their efforts to express their delight at his pardon their intense interest months after it was needed produced in the mind of lotus an inexpressible weariness he smiled as he remarked to clement having escaped from the water is it not remarkable how many of your friends are waiting on the shore to save you

they left grandville after a few days for minton lotus had nothing to say about the car in which he was obliged to ride the worst fare on earth was grateful after what he had just left

it was near the middle of may and as the two men sat in their shirt sleeves lotus noticed tangled in the lining of his coat a letter he turned the coat up and took it out it was the letter he had placed in his pocket unread the evening of his arrest it had slipped down between the lining and cloth and remained there unnoticed for all these months it is from mrs levitt he said

you arejesting said clement

no look for yourself the letter was sent to washington to the department and forwarded

well well written on brown paper with charcoal

read the explanation said lotus passing that to clement the explanation disclosed the fact that the letter had been received the previous june and being placed in the gentlemans hunting coat had escaped his attention until the day it had been mailed he had hung up his coat and had never thought of the letter until lie needed the hunting jacket he asked pardon for the delay and hoped the information would yet arrive in time to serve the end wished

what do you think of that why it is providential said clement

i expect she is dead before this said lotus thinking of his own fortunate delivery from a premature grave

no never she must be somewhere in canada well make it our first duty to find out looking at lotus he continued ill make it my first duty you will hardly be strong enough to undertake such business

when you go ill go with you we need not go for a few days by that time i shall be strong enough to accompany you

when the two friends arrived at minton lotus was surprised to see the red cross commandery drawn up in line at the depot to receive him clement had wired to his friends the day to expect them and the notoriety that the case of lotus had received through the papers served to bring to the station hundreds of people curious to see the man who had escaped from the jaws of that living hell lotus was pushed into a carriage to escape the enthusiasm of his friends the horses were taken from the carriage and escorted by the red cross commandery he was drawn to the home of clement st john nor was the brave editor of the events forgotten he came in for a large share of the glory that surrounded lotus already popular his conduct had served to make him an idol among the people he loved so well

dr stone was the lion of the hour for the next few weeks in minton the social world was at his feet no lawn fete private picnic or excursion was thought complete without his presence doting mothers courted his favor and men of high and low degree vied with each other in expressions of respect for him if lotus had not been unusually well balanced so much patronage would have turned his head to his credit it can be said that through it all he was wise enough to see the morbid curiosity that prompted the most of the attentions paid him the young girls liked to look at his hands callous from toil to hear him tell again and again some indignity he was made to suffer he grew tired of recounting his experiences and fain would have stolen away from the prying eyes of the curious crowds but where and how he could not refuse the invitations sent him for whatever the motive he was grateful for the consideration and intended kindness everywhere showered upon him

clement at last came to his rescue when are you going to be strong enough to make the trip to mt clare he asked one day as he and lotus were sitting in the office of the events

strong enough said lotus laughing a man who can endure the round of picnics balls and receptions i have been forced to attend for the past few weeks can be trusted to take a voyage around the world and steer his own yacht

i have been waiting for somebody to declare a flag of truce said clement and during the armistice i thought we might slip away to mt clare

anything or anywhere to deliver me from the gentle hands of my friends replied lotus

mt clare and the road to the lighthouse will be sufficiently exciting to create at least a healthy reaction from the too much joy business you have been indulging to distraction for some time past clement replied

i can be ready for the night boat said lotus you know i am a gentleman of leisure these days

suppose we say tomorrow evening said clement by that time the weekly edition will be off and i shall be more at liberty

you shall be the judge i have been so long under orders that i find it somewhat novel to decide for myself

the evening following found the two friends seated in the recess of the cabin of one of the splendid lake steamers which ply between minton and mt clare

i am willing to wager that i can indicate your mental processes for the past five minutes said clement after they had been sitting for some time watching the lights of minton one by one disappear

doughnuts to dollars that you cannot responded lotus

as i have neither i am safe in taking the wager said clement

well what was i thinking asked lotus

first of a night two years ago when you and i and a number of friends sat whiling the hours away enroute from mt clare to minton second of mt clare third of regenia underwood

you must be a mind reader the doughnuts are yours i was thinking a little of that night less of mt clare and a great deal of miss underwood said lotus

do you know said clement it has puzzled me to understand why you have always been so reticent when miss underwoods name was mentioned i have studiously managed to speak of her as infrequently as possibly gathering from your manner the few times i did speak of her that the subject was painful to you i am at loss to account for your indifference possessing as i do such undoubted proofs of her devotion to you

yes rather devoted a girl who could heartlessly desert a man because he was in trouble refuse to come near him because he was under the ban of dishonor hurry off to the seashore to flirt to her hearts content when the man she pretended to love is lingering between life and death in a convict mine i know that a convict has no claim on the affections of such a woman but a decent show of belief in my innocenceâ

dont say another word lotus if you do ill think you unworthy of the noble little woman whose pleading secured your pardon i did not get that pardon she went from office to office and from mansion to the governors chamber rehearsing as only a loving heart could portray the story of your wrongs she was unconscious for days after your arrest from a shock received at the hands of dr leighton the night before you were imprisoned for weeks before the doctor would allow her to know of your condition and when she did learn the truth did she sit down and weep and wring her hands not she she wrote letter after letter begging me to come and try to secure your release at last broken in health and fearing for her reason her friends pursuaded her through a ruse to go to lucile she was taken to the seashore and has only been kept there through the most gigantic fabrications for which may heaven forgive me

i am unworthy of her said lotus now thoroughly repentant why have you not told me all of this before he asked sorrowfully

simply because you did not deserve to know it your high blown pride had nearly brought me to the resolution never to tell you and to let you lose the only woman in the world you care for but i could not bring myself to do it old man he said laughing heartily as he thought how rapidly he had taken the wind from lotus inflated sails

you would have served me right said lotus i had gone on hardening my heart against regenia notwithstanding i was morally certain that there must be some extenuating circumstances what i could not make out was why she went to breeze nook

you expected her to be sitting at the depot day after day awaiting your arrival i suppose said clement sarcastically the display made over you here in minton has turned your head i suspect he did not think so but as he had lotus eating humble pie it was with a kind of fiendish delight he tried to keep him at the table

you do not think that do you clement asked lotus somewhat dejected

not exactly but i warn you if you ever say an unkind word nay think an unkind thought of that little angel who kissed me for you when in grandvilleâyou didnt know that either did you well lucile does and she thinks regenia never displayed such good taste before in her life

when she kissed you for me said lotus with a merry twinkle

she left me to draw my own conclusions i did not take your view of it said clement

they arrived at mt clare the next morning and went out to the elms they found the place looking much as it did the summer of the conclave the servants were still there and dr leighton spent a month or two during the year looking after the estate no time was lost dreaming of the past under the elms but securing a two seated carriage they drove down to the ferry took the left hand road keeping a sharp lookout for the lighthouse

we can drive on all night said clement and if we see no signs of the light house why tomorrow we can drive back

the lingering twilight had gone and the shades of evening closed in upon them before they saw in the distance the welcome rays emitted from the lighthouse windows they drove their horses into the woods below the house and thought best to reconnoitre before approaching and demanding the release of mrs levitt following a ravine which led them near the back part of the house they stopped to listen

from an open window in mrs levitts part they could hear the old woman talking to herself she was calling regenia regenia will that child never come she said i have been standing here night after night calling and waiting she came to the open window and stood gazing at the moon

how she has changed said lotus

she talks rather wildly said his companion

hush said lotus i thought i heard footsteps approaching

mrs levitt began to sing in a low crooning tone some old plantation hymn as she continued someone within yelled stop that i cant bear to hear it

the old woman sang on repeating the same words do you hear what i say if you dont come away from that window and shut your old mouth ill come in there to you repeated the hoarse voice

the singing stopped and then the old woman began again to call regenia regenia oh regenia where is that child ive been standing by this window calling her but she seems to never come having repeated this several times she commenced to sing the same weird song with the same repetitions from their watching place they saw a man come to the window and snatch the old woman away uttering oath after oath as he covered her with blows

lotus setting his teeth would have rushed to the rescue but the cooler head beside him counseled patience not yet not yet whispered clement he will leave for the lighthouse pretty soon and then we can seize our prize without bloodshed

for an hour they lay there awaiting events finally the man left the cabin for the lighthouse on his way he heard a horse neigh and following the ravine came upon clement and lotus he started on a run for the house but clement divining his purpose beat him to the door and turning closed with him they had been scuffling but a moment when the door flew open and the lighthouse keepers wife gun in hand came to her husbands rescue lotus covered her with his revolver and demanded that she drop the gun

by this time clement had brought the man to the earth and tying his hands behind him forbade him at the risk of his life to move while lotus stood guard clement went into the house and led mrs levitt out the woman did not seem sorry to see mrs levitt get her liberty

they put her in the carriage and drove rapidly to mt clare as the sun scattered the fog that gathered over river and lake the next morning the two friends and mrs levit were alighting from the carriage at the gate of the elms

mrs levitt was taken into the house but did not recognize the old servants nor did she know lotus or clement

the young men took their horses to the stable and as they had eaten nothing since the morning before they were in prime condition for eating without being coaxed after breakfast they returned to the elms to find mrs levitt washed and dressed and apparently in her right mind the old servant said she had wandered about the house calling regenia and apparently demented until she went upstairs and by chance walked into regenias old room stopping before a large painting she gazed upon it wildly for awhile and then bursting into tears for the first time she was concious of her surroundings

sitting in the parlor surrounded by the old servants mr st john and lotus she related the story of her stay in the home of the lighthouse tender

she did not spare dr leighton he wanted this property but i never intended that my child should be swindled out of it

he got it anyway you know he found the will said clement

he did said the old lady bounding out of her chair and leaving the room

they followed her thinking she was again losing her mind she went up into the garret and with a hatchet pried off the mantel and taking out a brick or two she drew from the chimney a tin box and bore it in triumph to the parlor

the box contained the deeds and securities for the underwood estates and the lost will mr st john took the papers and put them into the hands of old judge underwoods former law partner and mrs levitt swore out a warrant against dr leighton for kidnapping that night lotus and clement left for minton taking mrs levitt with them

regenia and lucile were cosily situated at breeze nook the freedom from care together with the saltladen sea breeze had not been long in bringing the roses back to regenias cheeks lucile too had ben benefited by her sojourn at breeze nook

clement had kept them in touch with the affair which was nearest regenias heart the successful termination of dr stones stay in the convict camp contributed in no small way to the robust health that regenia had lately regained peace of mind is always conducive to a well ordered physical condition the young women had lived much in the open air they had paid little heed to the effect this change was producing in their complexions what did they care if they were as brown as berries so they ate heartily and slept soundly every morning they walked on the beach and more than a score of times had seen the ruddy face of phoebus dripping with golden perspiration rise like a fire king from beneath the ever restless waves at eleven they took their daily plunge in the foaming surf in the evening they walked on the beach sat down in the white sand and through all this programme they talked of lotus and clement they did not join in the busy whirl everywhere buzzing around them

while the social world of breeze nook feasted and danced these two friends in pursuit of health how commonplace simply slept

breeze nook was the place to meet fashionable afroamerica here gathered the departmental clerk from washington frittering away that part of his thirty days vacation not already used the solid man from the city in pursuit of health or longdelayed pleasure school teachers from the far away south or west the porter of the fiat with the dress and airs of a millionaire the dude and dudess from nowhere in particular but everywhere in general the minister whose congregation has granted him a well earned vacation the editor seeking a rest from the arduous duties of hunting his subscription money the student seeking work to help him through college all kinds all classes of men and women of high and low degree flock to breeze nook for at least a day or two during the heated term it was amusing to regenia and lucile to observe these people in their efforts to assume airs of importance want of sociability is rare in afroamerica breeze nook in this respect was an exception it seemed to our friends that miss a fearful that a little courtesy would in the estimation of miss b detract from miss as social standing made miss a who at home was a friendly somebody at breezy nook a disgusting little snob

regenia and lucile having no particular social standard to keep up were content to act abroad as they did at home with becoming consideration for all they chanced to meet they did not think it necessary to act the lady they found it far simpier to be ladies their unassuming ways made them liked by all

the day mrs levitt was brought back to mt clare clement had telegraphed the good news to lucile regenia had been down to the beach alone that morning and when she returned lucile met her at the gate guess what has happened she said slipping her arm around regenias waist

i never was good at guessing tell me said regenia

i received a letter from clement said lucille with tantalizing deliberation

are they coming down

yes all three of them

three exclaimed regenia and who is the third one pray

the third is a woman

regenia stopped a moment and looking into luciles eyes said have they found her

lucile nodded yes and i have just sent them a telegram to repair at once to breeze nook

where did they find her did the telegram say how she was

now do you know what you are saying what do you want anyway in twentyfive cents worth of electricity i think they will be here by friday or saturday let me seeâthis is thursdayâyes they ought to get here by saturday anyway until then have patience she said as she tripped lightly up the steps to the house

true to the prediction of mrs st john saturday brought clement mrs levitt and lotus regenia and lucile were seated on the broad veranda when the cab drove up the driver had hardly opened the carriage door and assisted mrs levitt o alightbefore regenia had bounded down the steps and with her arms around mrs levitts  neck was covering her face with kisses

you dear old mamma you how glad i am to see you again careless of the lookerson forgetful of lotus and mr st john regenia clung to her foster mother as if she expected every moment some unkind fate would spring up to separate them

how i have missed you she continued

and i have missed you too dear said mrs levitt speaking through her tears

lucile had kissed her husband and given mr stone a rousing welcome and stood waiting for regenia to give mrs levitt a moments cessation so she could speak to her

clement at last broke the awkward silence i suppose you are not going to share your greeting with us less important folks

regenia blushing with confusion as she greeted clement said oh yes i am i was so glad to see dear old mamma that for a moment i forgot my other dear friends and you dr stone she said are you quite as well as you were when i saw you last

yes thanks to you and clement and ypu too mrs st john he said as she cast a saucy glance at him

i thought you were not going to leave me out

i was not in the forefront of battle but i was a powerful reserve

never fear i would sooner leave myself out than to detract one jot or tittle from the obligation i feel toward all my friends

none of that lotus you are under no obligation to anybody said clement you can feel just as thankful as you please but keep it to yourself we were only too glad to be of service

yes indeed and if you had not got out of that den as soon as you did i fear it would have been the death of all of us she said laughing and looking at regenia who at that moment was busily talking to mrs letvitt

that night and the next day were spent in hearing the experiences which each had passed through since last they were all together

monday at eleven they went bathing here as everywhere else discrimination exists the afroamericans had their separate bath houses and special part of the beach for bathing clement st john found this arrangement something to be thankful for he remarked to lotus as they came out of the water my suit would make a good life preserver it has been shingled so often referring to the numerous patches it contained i do not believe a fellow could sink in it if he tried

dr stone did not know whether to consider himself on the same terms with regenia as when they had last met or to commence over again he was not long in determining however the evening after the day just spoken of he invited regenia to take a walk on the beach by degrees he led up to the days at grandville and the months of suffering which had passed for them both they walked on in the moonlight talking over their pleasures and sorrows

we had better turn back said regenia we have walked a long way

they stopped and lotus taking her hand said can you forget perchance regret

no she said i can not forget i will not regret

it is all so different now i am a convict and you an heiress

have you changed is your heart the same as it was that happy night followed so soon by months of sorrow

my heart is the same but what was admissible then might be presumptuous now he replied

if you were suddenly made rich she said would you cease to love me

i could not cease to love you no matter what changes came replied lotus feelingly

do you think me less constant than yourself do you think i would ever enjoy a penny of that money without you never call yourself a convict again you are a nobleman upon whom fortune for a little while frowned what is the money worth when compared with the service you rendered me saved my life i have never forgotten that and more you offered me your love and i accepted it and returned it

the rough rocks roared as the mad waves dash against them the laughing whitecaps trembled and shook with suppressed merriment the moon glimmered again and again from behind the cloud but lotus and regenia recked them not as cupid led them captive back to the cottage

they sat on the veranda in the moonlight and talked it all over as lovers will regenia at last arose to go in he still held her hands and sought to see once more in her big brown eyes swimming in their liquid depths that truth so sweet to know i love you

as he leaned against the porch still holding her hands there was a scuffle a scream and the report of a revolver

clement st john came round the corner of the house holding his revolver in his hand nothing to be afraid of only my carelessness i was changing this revolver from one hand to the other and it went off he explained

for once his story was not believed by regenia she had seen dr leighton as he raised his revolver and in that awful moment had seen clement brush it aside from its mark

dr leighton had deliberately attempted to murder lotus but clement had saved him in the nick of time it had only been the work of a moment to wrench the revolver from the wouldbe assassins hand and his first thought was to shoot him but as dr leighton leaped over the backfence clement lowered the smoking revolver and through the awful stillness he could hear thou shalt not kill

everybody about the house condemned mr st john for his carelessness but regenia she alone knew the truth even lotus was unaware how near he had been to eternity

the morning paper described an accident which forever freed regenia from the fear of dr leighton as he bounded over the fence that night and slunk away under cover of the darkness he had to cross a dozen railroad tracks directly bebind the cottage from which he was fleeing runnig out of the way of one engine he did not see another which passed over him mangling his body beyond recognition a card in his pocket told who he was

lucile remarked on hearing the account read aloud on the veranda the next morning and this is the reality of your dream regenia do you remember the big fish and the incline car that mashed it into a thousand pieces

they gathered around while lucile related the dream

four years have passed since we last saw dr lotus stone and regenia underwood renewing their vows of undying affection at breeze nook during the following summer they were quietly married and took up lifes joys and sorrows at mt clare nothing particularly noteworthy has occurred since their marriage to distinguish them from the thousand and one happy families that pass unnoticed day by day

the doctor has unostentatiously followed his profession while his loving wife has spent much of her time in relieving the wants of the poor carrying the sunshine of christian sympathy where it is oftener needed than received one child a boy has come to bless their home he bears the name of dr stones best friend clement

clement and lucile still live at minton mr st john in the midst of an unusually busy life finds time to pull himself away from his paper and his politics each year to steal away to mt clare and spend two or three weeks at the elms

as we finish our story lucile and clement are at the elms mt clare again echoes to the tread of marching men this time it is the convocation instead of the conclave the patriarchie instead of the knights templars clement and lucile with their little girl regenia in company with dr stone and family have just returned from recreation park

again they have lived over the events of a summer long ago and sitting on the spacious veranda are interested observers as company after company of the tired patriarchies alight from the cars in front of the elms and make their way to the city

mrs levitt a pleasant smile on her broad loving face is sitting on the steps regenia as much of a child as ever when in the company of her foster mother sits at her feet lucile with her arm around regenias waist sits beside her talking incessantly clement and lotus are standing on the porch whiledittle regenia st john and clement stone hand in hand are observing from the yard with wildeyed delight the soldiers who from high private to self important captain wear the sword and uniform of an officer

as the happy friends sit talking the last rays oi the sun slowly setting falls in trembling reflections through the waving branches overheadsoftening and retouching the picture with tints of purest gold clement and lotus inspired by the sight instinctively turn toward each other lotus said after the clouds sunshine after the darkness light after sorrow joy

i was just thinking that the sight of such contentment is ample pay for all of the struggles and sorrows of the past responded clement sol the two men stood for some time silently contemplating the picture before them as they looked at the children hand in hand lotus turned to clement and taking the hand of his friend said may the lord be between me and thee and between mine and thine forever
