fuck tha police lyricsproduced by dr dre  dj yella
intro the doc dr dre and ice cube
right about now nwa court is in full effect
judge dre presiding
in the case of nwa versus the police department
prosecuting attorneys are mc ren ice cube
and eazymotherfuckinge
order order order
ice cube take the motherfucking stand
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help your black ass
you goddamn right
well wont you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say

verse  ice cube
fuck the police comin straight from the underground
a young nigga got it bad cause im brown
and not the other color so police think
they have the authority to kill a minority
fuck that shit cause i aint the one
for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
to be beating on and thrown in jail
we can go toetotoe in the middle of a cell
fuckin with me cause im a teenager
with a little bit of gold and a pager
searchin my car lookin for the product
thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics
youd rather see me in the pen
than me and lorenzo rollin in a benzo
beat a police out of shape
and when im finished bring the yellow tape
to tape off the scene of the slaughter
still getting swole off bread and water
i dont know if they fags or what
search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
and on the other hand without a gun they cant get none
but dont let it be a black and a white one
cause theyll slam ya down to the street top
black police showing out for the white cop
ice cube will swarm
on any motherfucker in a blue uniform
just cause im from the cpt
punk police are afraid of me huh
a young nigga on the warpath
and when im finished its gonna be a bloodbath
of cops dying in laÂ 
yo dre i got something to say
chorus
fuck the police fuck fuck
fuck the police fuck fuck
fuck the police fuck the fuck the
fuck the police example of scene one

skit  cop mc ren  dr dre
pull your goddamn ass over right now
aw shit now what the fuck you pullin me over for
cause i feel like it
just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
man fuck this shit
alright smartass im taking your black ass to jail
mc ren will you please give your testimony
to the jury about this fucked up incident

verse  mc ren
fuck the police and ren said it with authority
because the niggas on the street is a majority
a gang is with whoever im steppin
and the motherfuckin weapon is kept in
a stash spot for the socalled law
wishing ren was a nigga that they never saw
lights start flashing behind me
but theyre scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
but that shit dont work i just laugh
because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
for police im saying fuck you punk
reading my rights and shit its all junk
pulling out a silly club so you stand
with a fakeass badge and a gun in your hand
but take off the gun so you can see whats up
and well go at it punk and ima fuck you up
make you think ima kick your ass
but drop your gat and rens gonna blast
im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
but ima smoke em now and not next time
smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
or any asshole that threatens me
im a sniper with a hell of a scope
takin out a cop or two they cant cope with me
the motherfuckin villain thats mad
with potential to get bad as fuck
so ima turn it around
put in my clip yo and this is the sound gunshots
yeah somethin like that
but it all depends on the size of the gat
takin out a police would make my day
but a nigga like ren dont give a fuck to say
chorus
fuck the police fuck the fuck the
fuck the police fuck the fuck the
fuck the police fuck the fuck
fuck the police

skit  cop eazye and dr dre
knocking
yeah man what you need
police open now aww shit
we have a warrant for eazyes arrest battering ram
get down and put your hands right where i can see em move motherfucker move now
what the fuck did i do man what did i do
just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor you heard the man shut the fuck up
but i didnt do shit
man just shut the fuck up
eazye wont you step up to the stand
and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit
verse  eazye  mc ren
im tired of the motherfuckin jackin
sweating my gang while im chillin in the shack and
shining the light in my face and for what
maybe its because i kick so much butt
i kick ass or maybe cause i blast
on a stupid ass nigga when im playing with the trigger
of an uzi or an ak
cause the police always got somethin stupid to say
they put out my picture with silence
cause my identity by itself causes violence
the e with the criminal behavior
yeah im a gangsta but still i got flavor
without a gun and a badge what do you got
a sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
by me or another nigga
and with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger
size dont mean shit hes from the old school fool
and as you all know es here to rule
whenever im rollin keep lookin in the mirror
and ears on cue yo so i can hear a
dumb motherfucker with a gun
and if im rollin off the eight hell be the one
that i take out and then get away
while im driving off laughing this is what ill say
chorus
fuck the police fuck the fuck the

you are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
verse  ice cube

when im called off i got a sawedoff
squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
you too boy if you fuck with me
the police are gonna have to come and get me
off your ass thats how im going out
for the punk motherfuckers thats showing out
niggas start to mumble they wanna rumble
mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
going off on the motherfucker like that
with a gat thats pointed at your ass
so give it up smooth
aint no telling when im down for a jack move
heres a murder rap to keep yall dancin
with a crime record like charles manson
ak is the tool
dont make me act a motherfucking fool
me you can go toe to toe no maybe
im knocking niggas out the box daily
yo weekly monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
that im down with the capital cpt
boy you cant fuck with me
so when im in your neighborhood you better duck
cause ice cube is crazy as fuck
as i leave believe im stompin
but when i come back boy im coming straight outta compton

interlude  eazye  mc ren
yo ren whats up
tell em where you from

verse  mc ren
straight outta compton another crazyass nigga
more punks i smoke yo my rep gets bigger
im a bad motherfucker and you know this
but the pussyass niggas wont show this
but i dont give a fuck ima make my snaps
if not from the records from jacking or craps
just like burglary the definition is jacking
and when im legally armed its called packing
shoot a motherfucker in a minute
i find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
so if youre at a show in the front row
ima call you a bitch or dirtyass ho
youll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
but that shows me slut youre not opposed to
a crazy motherfucker from the street
attitude legit cause im tearing up shit
mc ren controls the automatic
for any dumb motherfucker that starts static
not the right hand cause im the hand itself
every time i pull an ak off the shelf
the security is maximum and thats a law
ren spells ren but im raw
see cause im the motherfucking villain
the definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
thats taking place without a clue
and once youre on the scope your ass is through
look you might take it as a trip
but a nigga like ren is on a gangsta tip
straight outta compton
compton compton compton

but dont know where the fuck hes going just rolling
looking for the one they call eazy
but heres a flash theyll never seize me
ruthless never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when i unload
you see a spark and jump over hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
feel a little gust of wind and im jetting
but leave a memory no onell be forgetting
so what about the bitch who got shot fuck her

express yourself lyricsintro dr dre  ice cube
yo man its a lot of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin but scared to kick reality
man youve been doin all this dope producing you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
so what you want me to do express yourself

verse  dr dre
im expressing with my full capabilities
and now im living in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree with how i do this
i get straight meditate like a buddhist
im dropping flavor my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he says it gets funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and thatll make you think
some suckers just tickle me pink
to my stomach cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to dis one
or two before im through so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im dropping english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nothing
but making a sucker and you equal dont be another sequel
chorus
express yourself ah ah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah
express yourself smoke smoke
come on and do it yeah kick it over here
express yourself do it do it 
express yourself
come on and do it

verse  dr dre
now getting back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressing aint their subject because they like to follow
the words the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again yo you on the other end
watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessing and guessing while im expressing myself
its crazy to see people be
what society wants them to be but not me
ruthless is the way to go they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hiphop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
some musicians cuss at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go looking for the dopeman
or they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say hell no
but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to
chorus
express yourself yeah yeah yeah 
express yourself
come on and do it yeah yeah do it
express yourself dr dre dr dre in full effect and nwa
express yourself
come on and do it
express yourself

verse  dr dre
from the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
then expression is a big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow
you aint swift moving like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
or a lesson all of em expression
and if you start fessing i got a smith and wesson for you
i might ignore your record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic getting physical
doing the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but you know you need this
and the knowledge is growing just like a fetus
or a tumor but heres the rumor
dre is in the neighborhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressing myself yella slam it
cause if i stay funky like this im doing damage
or imma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we getting hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just
outro
express yourself yeah yeah this records almost over almost over gotta get hyped up
express yourself do it do it
come on and do it do it do it do it
express yourself comptons full of fakes comptons full of fakes yeah
express yourself
come on and do it do it do it do it
express yourself
come on and do it thats what she said what she said
come on and do it
come on and do itembed

now the title bitch dont apply to all women
but all women have a little bitch in em
its like a disease that plagues their character
taking the women of america
and it starts with the letter b
it makes a girl like that think she better than me bitch
see some get mad and some just bear it
but yo if the shoe fits wear it

verse  mc ren
prisoner like a hostage
yo you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich

and you ass up high so i can kick the muthafucker
dont try to hang you best avoid
cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemorrhoids
before you try to fuck wit ren
ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting a size 

verse  dr dre
first come first serve whoevers got the nerve
step up and get what you deserve
from the word of a muthafucking hiphop maniac
brainiac so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
now how the fuck you think a rap will last
wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
yo be original your shit is sloppy
get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy

verse  mc ren
falling deep in the drums so many of styles
is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
cheating and now beating the crowd i kept seating
but weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
styles that kept them full of bull
cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
they got the nerve to cuss
only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
verse  dr dre
yo giving what i gotta give doing what i gotta do
you dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
you cant harm me alarm me
cause were the generals in this fucking hiphop army
the niggas wit attitudes if you didnt know
we blow flow and getting loose slow from the get go yo
try us and take it
yo fuck this shit yella kick the break in

hook
its the real thing you are now real real niggas niggas

verse  mc ren
you can run but you cant hide you know imma findcha
cause a nigga like rens only  steps behindcha
dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
a nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
so sleep wit the lights on forget that the mics on
dont step on my muthafucking stage without nikes on
dont say its psycho and then you just might go
mentally fucked up when i let the right blow

verse  dr dre
all these niggas wit the jibber jabber
but couldnt kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
gangstas in black are out there
but only because yo its the shit that we wear
on my muthafucking dick
but imma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
so yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
you get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead
verse  eazye   mc ren 
black the good the bad the ugly you see
a little streetwise nigga you know me
rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
but you muthafuckas know who run the streets
wit that hardcore hiphop rap shit
now how much harder can another nigga get
trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
ashes to ashes and dust to dust
so nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
cause im a muthafucka thats out to kill

appetite for destruction lyricsverse  dr dre
i got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
murder i heard her when she screamed the drop
cause her son caught the slug
relate this to no choice
and listen to this straightup man before they ban the voice
while i rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot
whoever said that what i say and portray is negativity
need to come kick it in the city with me
and find the black and crack the fact
and take that shit back
cause they dont wanna fuck with that
theres too many niggas theyre trying to calm
if motherfuckers could get it nobody wouldve fucked with it
appetite for destruction
for him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
murder in the first degree and manslaughter
taking the life of his wife and young daughter
a whole city of bitches that look sucked up
and the niggas is killing its straight fucked up
whoever saying what im sayings for greed
then i aint even what theyre trying to feed
my appetite for destruction
sample
you guys know who im talking to

verse  mc ren
the appetite is tremendous so im gonna spin this
drop up some violence cause they asked me to end this
some trouble that i caught cause i was noisy
a nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
he took a swing for my head thought i was faded
started running for the door but the fucker never made it
the sound of the nine went bang
and all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
cause im a nigga you cant sleep on
so set the alarm cause i hit like a motherfucking bomb
i do damage with the nine in my hand
but the average nigga that dont know me dont understand
im from the streets so therefore
you know i dont care for a sucker that aint down
with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
yo and thats the way shit gotta go aint even sober
any time that the nine wanna leave
i got a  hidden up the sleeve
and its ready to go to war cause thats what its here for
i shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
and thats the million and one they couldnt hang with the appetite cause they wasnt rapping right
so i had to destroy whoever was standing in my presence
for fucking up the essence
appetite for destruction
interlude
cops put a hurting on your ass man
you know they really degrade you
white folks dont believe that shit
they dont believe that cops degrade you
imitating white person oh come on those people those people are resisting arrest

verse  eazye
check it out yall in the house yall
so i can show and flow and let the people know
so wont you ease on down to the yellow brick road
to compton but first let me tell you something
i possess the ten commandments of the hiphop thugsta
known as the thief and murderer
first one honor thy nigga with an attitude
gotta get respect or break your motherfucking neck
second one always gotta fuck out of wedlock
i like it when the pussy go snap crackle and pop
number three im a gangsta fanatic
i smoke any fools tryna cause some static
number four heres whats in store
a crazyass nigga that remains hardcore
fifth one my killing has begun
i pull out my gun thatll keep me on the run
step six hmmm its kinda tricky
cant forget that im motherfucking chickenshit
to the ones who tries to play the e
by the time you get to seven youll be six feet deep
number eight make no mistake
move real sneaky and youre bound to catch your prey
ninth one i gotta be raw
fuck any brainwashing manmade law
last but not least i must be real
number ten is my appetite to killembed
 miles and runnin lyricsintro fbi  mc ren
catch those motherfuckers catch them catch them
hey man keep up keep up this way come on man hurry up
you dont really think youre gonna get away do you
we havent spotted them yet but theyre somewhere in the immediate vicinity

verse  mc ren
a  miles and runnin   mc ren i hold the gun and
you want me to kill a mutherfucker and its done in
since im stereotyped to kill and destruct 
is one of the main reasons i dont give a fuck
chances are usually not good
cause im frisked with my hands on a hot hood
and gettin jacked by the youknowwho
when in a black and white the capacity is two
were not alone were three more brothers i mean streetbrothers
not wearing medallions cause were not stupid mutherfuckers
theyre out to take our heads for what we said in the past
point blank they can kiss my black ass
i didnt stutter when i said fuck tha police
cause its hard for a nigga to get peace
now its broken and cant be fixed
cause police and little black niggas dont mix so
now im creepin through the fall
runnin like a g well see i might have slayed yall
so for now pack the gun and
hold it in the air cause mc ren has a  miles of runnin
interlude
in todays news four fugitives are on the run
fbi sources tell us that the four are headed
 miles to their home base compton

break dr dre  eazye
lend me a mutherfuckin ear
so i can tell you why
verse  dr dre
runnin with my brothers headed for the homebase
with a steady pace on the face that just reads race
the road ahead goes on and on
the shit is gettin longer than the mutherfuckin marathon
runnin on but never runnin out
stayin wired and if i get tired i can still try out
hitchhikin if thats what it gotta do
but nobodys pickin up a nigga witta attitude
confused yo but dres a nigga with nuthin to lose
one of the few whos been accused and abused
of the crime of poisonin young minds
but you dont know shit til you been in my shoes
and dre is back from the cpt
droppin some shit thats dope
so fuck the police
and any mutherfucker that disagrees
stuck and runnin hard hauling ass
cause i been a nigga known for havin a notorious past
my mind was slick  my temper was too quick
now the fbis all over my dick
verse  eazye
got the stick and runnin just to find the gun that started the clock
thats when the e jumped off the startin block
a  miles from home and yo its a long stretch
a little sprintin mutherfucker that they wont catch
yeah back to compton again
yo its either that or the federal pen
cause niggas been runnin since beginning of time
takin a minute to tell you whats on my mutherfuckin mind
runnin like i just dont care
comptons  miles but yo imma get there
archin my back and on a straight route
just like carl lewis im ballin the fuck out
from city to city im a menace as i pass by
rippin up shit just so you can remember im
a straight up nigga thats done in gunnin and comin
straight at yo ass a  miles and runnin

interlude
this one goes out to the four brothers from compton
youre almost there but the fbi has a little message for you
nowhere to run to baby nowhere to hide
good luck brothers

verse  mc ren
runnin like a nigga i hate to lose
show me on the news but i hate to be abused
i know it was a setup  so now im gonna get up
even if the fbi wants me to shut up
but ive got   niggas strong
they got everybody singin my fuck tha police song
and while they treat my group like dirt
their whole fuckin family is wearin our tshirts
so imma run til i cant run no more
cause its time for mc ren to settle the score
i got a urge to kick down doors
at my grave like a slave even if the ren calls
verse  dr dre
clouds are dark and brothers are hidin
dicktricklin at the sunny mutherfuckers are ridin
started with five and yo one couldnt take it
so now theres four cause the fifth couldnt make it
the numbers even  now im leavin
were never gettin took by a bitch with a weave in
her and the troops are right behind me
but theyre so fuckin stupid theyll never find me

verse  eazye
one more mile to go through the dark streets
runnin like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
but you know i never stumble or lag last
im almost home so i better haul ass
tearin up everything in sight
its a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
now that chase the shit is done and

and for the shit that she does give her a drum roll
because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
and shell let you videotape her
and if you got a gang of niggas the bitch would let you rape her
she likes suckin on dicks and lickin up nut
and they even take the broomstick up the butt
just to say that she did it with a rapper
but the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
but how many licks would it take she asks
to make mc ren start gooshin up vanilla shakes
she took her tongue out her mouth put it on top
like a cherry started movin it like a snake and it was very irresistible
i couldnt pay the bitch to quit
cuz the ho was doin some ol crazy shit
that made me start havin a fit
cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick suck this dick

verse  mc ren
now one night i was at a drivein
and a car full of niggas straight drove in
i thought they wuz commin to start trouble but no
five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho
now what do you expect theyre gonna dog her like a doggy
thirty minutes later and the windows all were foggy
and im off in my car havin a fit cuz the bitch that im with
said no fuckin on the first date shit
and im like damn i wish i was in the bucket
to be the sixth nigga with the ho and i can fuck it
so i told the bitch i was with that im goin to the snack bar
and got the fuck out the car
went to the bucket and i looked through the window
it was some niggas that i knew they let me in yo
and my turn was like next
i couldnt see her face all i saw was her pussy and her chest
i wanted to see the face i felt i oughta
peep over the seat oh shit its the preachers daughter
and shes only  and a ho
but the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
she looked at me i was surprised
but wasnt passin up the chance of my dick gettin baptized
i told the bitch to do it quick
you little ho hurry up and suck my dick

now im a break it down with a fact
since the last just dont bite it girls dont know how to act
sayin that they never would suck a dick
but when theyve tried it they couldnt quit
cuz ninety percent of the bitches today they love that shit
and those are the main ones that say they dont do it
but mc ren knows the bitches are used to it
so fellas next time they try to tell a lie
that they never suck a dick punch a bitch in the eye
and then the ho will fall to the ground
then youll open up her mouth
put your dick in and move the shit around
and shell catch on and start doin it on her own
actin like shes tryin to suck the meat off a chicken bone
and then she wont let go
because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like drano
get the last drop unclogging the pipe
then the stupid bitch is out doing that same shit the next night
because she just cant quit
cuz shes addicted addicted
shes addicted addicted
shes addicted to suck a good dick

if it aint ruff lyricsintro
aint that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug you know

verse  mc ren
ren is the villain and youre just an hostage
so whenever im steppin cover your head like an ostrich
groupies been waitin for this suckers been hatin for this
you know why because so many are relatin to this
jealous is how they feel it intentionally
but they start to love it because i made it eventually
pumpin the music i keep the music like pumpin
cause ren aint in here for nothin i keep the average crowd jumpin
yo you know the color the villains in black
always down to make noise and attack
so you better get back unless you wanna come with it
and make your face like a target and close your eyes when i hit it
youre screamin with fear but its with fear that youre screamin
youre wakin up in a sweat cause ren is givin bad dreams and
im not schemin im just tellin the facts
thats how it is when nwa starts to jack
so brothers that wanna scrap with me
that sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me
especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
i just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
cause when it comes to ren theres no comparison
and if you try to be me its quite embarrassin
but i understand cause youre mentally slow
cause i can tell from the jump youre too nervous to go
chorus
if it aint ruff it aint me
the gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me
lemme bust a freestyle there  alright bet

verse  mc ren
i can tell that youre afraid to fight me
simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
because your sweat is a puddle but theres a puddle o sweat
im a threat so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
and clean the dirt off your face that causes acne
its ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
this is the round where the punch will go
into your head thats known as a blow
im makin a point but its a point that im makin
like see im hatin the fakin i keep the suckers like shakin
scared to speak with a thought when theyre chosen
the sound of my voice in their ear and theyre frozen
this is a battle to the death its like the same ol
against a brother on a tip with a kangol
givin a pain but its with pain that im givin
but im comparin and tearin em but im makin a livin
with the hype of a nine volt battery
and the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
meanin imma flow
im from the streets so yo im ready to go
chorus
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
the gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me
man whatcha gonna do now  get funky

verse  mc ren
the do not disturb sign is in effect
while im thinkin of a fool to select
to give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then i kick them
tell em theyre guilty and peep out the bailer
and get a new track o drums so i can play with
percussion pumpin it loud when i perform
yo you wanna play in my game put on a uniform
it aint a rule in the book you have to go by
hey cause when it comes to cheatin yo you should know i
for fear in the hearts cause its the hearts full of fear
coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
the hulk was incredible yo but ren he was super
but now im ruthless a civilian and not a trooper
but a soldier with a top rankin
givin dope material the hell with the gankin
so play like an airplane and just jet
and keep your blood pressure low cause im a threat if not
im afraid of the show
that youre a sucker and youre too nervous to go
chorus

the gangstas black and hes about to attack

parental discretion iz advised lyricsone two three kick it

intro the doc
aiyyo dre whats goin on man whats goin on
ay what chall gonna do for this last record
nah tell me what chaall gonna do
okay you want me to do the intro aight

verse  the doc
parental discretion is advised for the moment
while im getting candid now understand it
aint too typical in any way though the pro
on the mic is the do to the c this is an intro
i know the doc makes you want to take a valium
so buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album
and for the record meaning my record check it
listen to the single and youll be like yo i gotta get it
but in the meantime listen to the rhyme
of the dr dre played with nwa
yellas on the drum roll rocking the beat
aiyyo dre wheres you gonna take this shit man
verse  dr dre
aiyyo lets take it to the street word up
let em understand perfection
let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing
cause i dont give a fuck about radio play
observe the english i display
lyrics for the adults children have been barred
and scarred from listening to something so motherfucking hard
dope pumping thats so my shit will never falter
yo its dre so fuck the mind of minolta
psycho like no other motherfucker
so step to me wrong go for what you no
but be warned never will i leave like a regular
cause im a little better than the regular competitor
i use to see em on stage
earning money like a thief but without a gauge
until i got full of clocking the lame getting pull
they said you wasnt gon get paid
nah thats bullshit they like it stylistic
and i enchant the crowd like im a mystic
cccc ccccameras are flashing when im in action
a photo or fresh with a flair for fashion
pure simplicity  see its elementary
you hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century
try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
parental discretion is advised
verse  mc ren
ren is most extremely high performance
the black hat cause i worn this cause its like enormous
some shit i dont take it not even in a toilet
and shit from a sucker put in a pot and ill boil it
turn up the pilot as it burns
and maybe the motherfuckers will learn
im not a sub cause i speak sensible
not considered a prince cause im a principal
im engineering the shit that youre hearing
cause when it comes to power im power steering
silly you say i say youre silly when you say it
rushing to the eject to put my shit in and play it
its like apollo but im not an amateur
and im not giving a fuck while im damaging ya
its for the record so rens lyrics is gonna spin it
and if there was a trophy involved id win it
possession is mine and im the holder
cause a nigga like ren dont give a fuck cause im older
so for you to step off would be wise
and say fuck it parental discretion is advised

verse  ice cube
i be what is known as a bandit
you gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
cause if you fail to see read it in braille
itll still be funky  so whats next is the flex
of a genius my rapidstutterstepping if you seen this
dope you hope that i dont really mean this
but if play made a greater hightop fade
its not my trademark when i get loose in the dark
you guess it was a test of a different style
its just another motherfucker on the pile
driving your ass with the flow of the tongue
you hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung
to your attention by the hardest motherfucking artist
that is known for lynching any sucker in a minute
stagger em all
when i start flowing like niagara falls
ice cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
move like a snake when im mad and then my tail rattle
i get low on the flow so let your kids know
when i bust parental discretion is a must
verse  eazye
little did they know that i would be arriving
and its surprising rocking it from where i been
but its the e here to take no mistake to be made
in the trade where funky ass records are being played
fuck the regular yo as i get better the
bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
so i get em hot thinking theyre gonna get it
as they sit rubbing their legs like a cricket
to you it may be funny but
theres no service of beef without money
so slip the cnote and you can choke
on a wingdingdingaling down your throat
foreplay to me aint shit
when you spread em im ready then you can get the dick
of the eaz if you can deal with the size
but if you cant parental discretions advised

niggaz  life lyricsopening dialogue
why you brothers insist on usin the word nigga

hospital monitor starts beeping
fuck the niggas
motherfuckers need to stop
how can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it
monitor stops beeping  rip
orderly flatline
dr dre bullshit
verse  mc ren
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me
well its because motherfuckers wanna blast me
and run me outta my neighborhood
and label me as a dope dealer yo and say that im no good
but i gave out jobs so niggas wouldnt have to go out
gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
when the cops came they gave a fake name
because the life in the streets is just a head game
so therefore to make more
a yearold black kidll go and rob a liquor store
and get shot in the process
he ate up a nine bullet and now hes put to rest

verse  dr dre
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me
i guess its just the way shit has to be
back when i was young gettin a job was murder
fuck flippin burgers cause i deserve a
ninetofive i can be proud of that i can speak loud of
and to help a nigga get out of
yo the concrete playground
but most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
but im a smart motherfucker you see
one of the best producers in the rap music industry
gettin paid like a motherfucker
a young brother who dont give a fuck about another
yeah
verse  mc ren
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me
because police always wanna harass me
every time that im rollin
they swear up and down that the car was stolen
make me get face down in the street
and throw the shit out my car on the concrete
in front of a residence
a million white motherfuckers on my back like i shot the president

verse  dr dre
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me
because my mouth is so motherfuckin nasty
bitch this bitch that nigga this nigga that
in the mean while my pockets are gettin fat
gettin paid to say this shit here
makin more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
so why not call myself a nigga
its better than pullin the trigger and goin up the river
and then i get called a nigga anyway
broke as a motherfucker and locked away so
so cut out all that bullshit
yo i guess ill be a nigga for life

interlude eazye

the attention of another i mean the other
but im a motherfucker thatll have em runnin for cover

except gettin paid gettin bitches and issuin stitches
which is all needed to read it and find a rhyme
and then its time to say the niggas here to stay
but what about the fake niggas the house niggas
to get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
but nwa is outta your motherfuckin range
we aint gonna change a motherfuckin thang

verse  mc ren
i call myself a nigga cause my skin wont lighten
i call myself a nigga cause the shit that im writin
hypes me hypes other motherfuckers around me
and thats the reason why they wanna surround me
and ask me  why do i call myself a negro
aint none of their fuckin business cause ill let the trigger go
so get out my presence and get out of my sight
cause mc ren is a nigga for life

final dialogue
youre a nigga til you die
if youre a po nigga youre a po nigga
if youre a rich nigga youre a rich nigga

some start to mumble they wanna rumble
mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
going off on everybody like that
with bass thats droppin in your face
so give it up smooth
aint no telling when im down for a jack move
heres a murder rap to keep you dancing
with a crime record like charles manson
yo dre whats the sound of my tool
now you know that im about to act a fool
me you can go toe to toe no maybe
im knocking suckas out the box daily
yo weekly monthly and yearly
until the whole damn world see clearly
that im down with the capital cpt

verse  mc ren
straight outta compton a brotha with his finger on the trigger
more punks i take out my rep gets bigger
im a ruthless villain and you know this
but the suckas in the public wont show this
but i dont really care imma make my snaps
if not from the records from jacking the craps
its like burglary the definition is jacking
and when illegally armed its called packing
knock a fool out in a sec
i find somebody talkin trash and put em in check
so if youre at a show in the front row
imma call you a sucka if you dont go with the flow
youll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to
but that shows me yo youre composed to
a crazy young brotha from the street
attitude legit cause im ready to hit
mc ren controls the automatic
for any fool in my way that starts static
not the right hand cause im the hand itself
every time i pull a ak off the shelf
the security is maximum and thats a law
ren spells ren but im raw
see cause people know me as a villain
the definition is clear youre the witness of a killing
thats taking place without a clue
and once youre on the scope you know youre through
look you might take it as a trip
but a brotha like ren is on a gangsta tip
straight outta compton
dr dre
eazy is his name and the boy is coming

verse  eazy e
straight outta compton
is a brother thatll smother your mother
and make your sister think i love her
dangerous young brotha raising hell
and if i ever get caught i make bail
see i dont really care thats the problem
when i see a police i dont dodge him
but im smart lay low creep a while
and when i see the punk pass i smile
to me its kinda funny the attitude showing suckas driving
but dont know where the hell they going just rolling
looking for the one they call eazy
but heres a flash they never seize me
ruthless
never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when i unload
you see ill get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
feel a little gust of wind and now im jetting
and leave a memory no onell be forgetting
so what about the girl who got shot garbled

narrator
has this ever happened to you
does her teeth get in the way while shes sucking your dick
does she know how to suck a dick
well i had that same problem until my bitch went out and bought nwas new book entitled the art of sucking dick

bitch
lesson   first you grab the dick
next you gently lick it up and down then insert it into the mouth
take it slow dont rush it and before you know it 
splash
eazye
it goes one for the treble two for the bass
she got nut all over her face
kick kick it 

verse  mc ren
slow is the tempo and ren is gonna flow
as i produce and illustrate you to a ho
caught on the late night stomping on the basepipe
shes a hype to get you on the late flight
but back in school she was a cutie yo
then after graduation started giving up the booty
in school stuck her head in a feather
every time i asked her whats the time
it was never ever what she would talk to the ren im sayin
i wanted a date she wouldnt even be my friend
but now in the s id be praying that the bitch dont find me
cause shes got a gang o kidz nappyheads and all dirty
and shes getting pimped by a nigga thats thirty
i saw her hanging in an alley
raggin to her friends how shes hoin in the valley
all by herself doin on the ho stroll
comin back home late night with the bankroll
you know a bitch like that makes me sick
but ive heard that she sucks a good dick
hook
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
its the worlds biggest dick
dont matter just dont bite it
what do you want me to do with it
dont matter just dont bite it
she swallowed it yeah

verse  mc ren
at a high school dance me and the niggas bailed in
i saw her sittin with her friends with the clan
so sexy thought she was all that
she wouldnt even look at us because we wore the black hat
she was a stuckup bitch on the public floor
but an instant prostitute behind closed doors
on the streets shes a late night feature
walking home from school i saw her sucking a niggas dick under the bleachers
she saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
but a bitch full of nut couldnt escape in the chase
a disgrace if i ever ever saw one
there wasnt a nigga on the block late at night not getting done
so she begged me not to tell a soul
then i said of course cause my dick yo its harder than a totem pole
then again it dont concern me
cause theres a slight chance if i fuck she might burn me
and then i might have to shoot the ho

express yourself extended mix lyricsintro
dr dre yo man theres alot of brothers out there flakin and perpatratin who scared to kick reality
ice cube yo dre youve been doin all this dope producin you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
dr dre so watch do you want me to do

entrence
all you got to do now express yourself

verse  dr dre
im expressin with my full capabilities
now im livin in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree with how i do this
i get straight meditate like a buddhist
im droppin flavor my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he said it gets funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and itll make ya think
some suckers just tickle me pink to my stomach
cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to dis one or two before im through
so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im droppin english
even if yella makes it acapella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nothin
but makin a sucker and you equal
dont be another sequel
hook
express yourself
do it good
express yourself
oh do it

verse  dr dre  ice cube
ice cube is not for the pop charts
so where should a brother like you start expressin yourself
my boyll show you how
yo dre   what up  drop english right about
now gettin back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back  new jacks are made hollow
expressin aint their subject because they like to follow the words
the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again
yo ya on the other end
watch a brother playin dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessin and guessin while im expressin myself
its crazy to see people be what society wants em to be
but not me
ruthless is the way to go they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hiphop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
and those musicians curse at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go lookin for the dope man
oh they ban my group from the radio
hear nwa and say hell no
but you know it aint all about wealth
as long as you make a note to
express yourself
hook
express yourself
do it do
express yourself
oh do it

verse  dr dre  mc ren
a lyricist yo dre is the name for it
to make somethin dope on a record thats what he came for
kickin reality yo but staying hisself
but its important to keep it in mind to express yourself
from the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then
expression is big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow you aint swift
movin like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
or a lesson all of them expression
and if you start fessin i got a smithwesson for ya
i might ignore your record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic gettin physical
doin the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but you know you need this
and the knowledge is growin just like a fetus
or a tumor but heres the rumour dres in the neighborhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressin myself yella slam it
cause if i stay funky like this im doin damage
or imma be too hyped i need a straight jacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we gettin hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just
express yourself
hook
express yourself
do it good
express yourself
oh do itembed

im getting rid of muthafuckas as if they was a foreigner

i punch you can block it but ima still get in
this aint a tko in the first
but its some shit from a nigga in black and much worse
than a beating from tyson cause ren is not nice and
your ass is better off just rolling a dice and
finding you a number for luck
cause you will need it when you see i dont give a fuck
my identity and the shit is getting shown
without a video im still getting known yeah
im at a show then my picture is taken
one click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin
to the door tryin to join my fan club
lipsyncin over one of my dubs
an instrumental will scratch for the moment
until i fuck up the so called opponent
thats standing in the zone of the twilight
saying how in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight
it wasnt a mistake it was a setup
so until im finished pumpin my lyrics you should shut up
and dont attempt to speak
because its bad enough youre rollin up shit creek
with a nigga like ren about the hit
now let me hear you muthafuckas talk some more shit
or ima bust your ass in the mouth
yo unless youre saying comptons in the house

verse  dr dre  eazye
who really cares  about a sucker on a take off
bust a move we can have a shake and bakeoff
me and you can go cause i dont care
yo rap fight or guerrilla warfare
we can rumble cause when my lungs go in and out
i kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout
or scurry or scuffle
i just muffle the opposition theres no competition
let em know that dre is getting stronger
comptons in the house but now its some longer
i wont get setup shut up im kinda fed up

of a motherfuckers billy club he took his gun and

real niggas dont die cause they eventually multiply
the niggas im with they take an eye for an eye
because the times are so wrong gotta stay so strong
niggas gotta keep it goin on and on
and dont let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race
have your residence occupyin a jail space
thats what they want to do cause the system is fucked around
i try to let you know with the records thats underground
they dont give a fuck about a nigga they would rather pull the trigger
and have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin cheese
so nigga get smart and rebel back
im not with that black shit so im not gonna yell that
all i see is niggas getting harassed
and cant do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass yo
but if every nigga grabbed a nine
and started shootin motherfuckers it would put em in line
and thats how its supposed to be
when a pussyass nigga try to fuck with me
yo because its useless to try
to kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga dont die

quiet on tha set lyricsintro
eazye yo ren
mc ren  what up
eazye take one
mc ren yo
eazye hit it

verse  mc ren
ruthless plenty of that and much more
so at the party ren is controllin the floor
that you step and do your dance routine
it aint a dream my man youre in a gangsta scene
with a villain doin damage on a  track
with no confusion to finish my conclusion
rythymatic rhymes from a radio cat
you cant take what i got coz ill be takin it right back
ruthless gangsta  cold killin
you wanna know what its means  definition villain
with the stupid dope rhyme
so once you hear one line you can tell its mine
with a baseball cap thats black that im wearin
and a look that keeps you all starin
and wondering why im invincible
but when you hear my rhyme its convincible
i dont take no shorts while im constructing the ground
that makes yall move around to my hell of a sound
girls drool on me like a diamond
yo ren tell them what they do when you start rhymin
i go to the party i hip i hop the spot
i dunno what it is but the girls get hot
perspirin like theyre on fire and
their socalled boyfriends withem are retirin
and for this reason im a walkin threat
so when im on stage i want quiet on tha set
light camera action nwa take two

verse  mc ren
now to get started with my musical profession
a gangsta or villain in mine is in session
the way that im referrin to this makes ya move ya butt
but dont stand in a daze yeah you should know whats up
anyway i keep em clappin along
cause nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
im like toyota who could ask for anything more
when nwa is cold rockin the floor
like stupid actin like a retard
waitin for a bumrush gettin to the good part
it tempts me so with temptation
writin my lyrics with this hyped information
this is a section of my creation
so dont say shhh with an explanation
just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
boy you should have known by now its mine
unpredictable keepin you extremely enjoyed
its irresistible meaning that you cant avoid
and while im on stage look forward to sweat
but after i rip it up i want quiet on tha set

light camera action nwa take three
verse  mc ren  eazye
i can be loud as hell think i will never
quiet on tha set  yeah i like that better
cause what i can do i think i earn respect
and if i didnt from you thats what i expect
cause if it aint ruff it aint me
so who really cares how you want me to be
see im just mean staying at the top of the pile
and doin soft note tunes it aint my style
and this concludes our program
of how nwa makes a ruthless jam
now first we take an average drum
give it to dre and the boy gets dumb
its no secret that i sit alone at night
pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
all kinda lyrics thats promised to play
to make everybody say

sample
they can be cold and ruthless no question about that
but sometimes its more complicated

yo dre
you know what i want you to do
bring that beat back bring that beat back
verse  mc ren
now mc ren is here working like super glue
no matter what i do im always stickin to you
cause im the pusher supplying the fix
and this jams so dope it dont need a remix
but im making obstacles of enemy traps
to catch any mcs with the weakest raps
crucifyin in vain like just for usin my name
the definition is pain but thats the thing o the game
if they try to retreat i catchem one at a time
cause theyre comittin a crime and still promotin a rhyme
so you in the back of me just listen and learn
because youll all get a chance or maybe a turn
now my assignment was to give a preview
so at my next concert i wanna see you there
not sittin in a chair standin on both feet with yo hand in the air
now im about to jet out but ill be back
but next time expect a more funkier track
deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
with lyrics thats smooth to start some discussion
the prove that im hype and you know thats bet
now continue to dance coz im thru with tha setembed
one less bitch lyricsintro mc ren  dr dre
the worlds most dangerous group
once again beating on your motherfucking eardrums
doing much damage for all you slutty ass hoes

verse  dr dre
yo there was a bitch i knew on the avenue
she was good to go for a nut or two yo
i think her name was clara
and she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
to be perfectly honest she was a hooker
so i took her a hundred yards to the boulevard
i told her ill take care of you you take care of me
youve got a pimp and all i want is the money
she went to work and the niggas were fiendin
yo she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
in fact she was like medusa with titties full grown
one look and your dick turns to stone yeah
keepin in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
because she knows im not to be fucked with
she aint crazy
fuckin with dre shell be pushin up daisies
she was the perfect ho but wouldnt you know
the bitch tried to gank me so
i had to kill her
yeah straight hittin
now listen up and lemme tell you how i did it
yo i tied her to the bed i was thinking the worst
but yo i had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
loaded up the fortyfo yo
then i straight smoked the ho
cause im a real nigga but i guess she figured
i was soft and she paid the cost to the boss and got tossed
one less bitch you gotta worry about
shes outta here and thats how it turns out
verse  dr dre
now vicky vicky vicky shes very tricky
she put her hickey on top of my dick sick bitch see
she told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
if only she can have the dick weekly
i said im with it but baby you gotta hold up
if i was happy with somethin that i could fold up
we can do this  she said her husband was rich
then i knew i had the bitch
yo she wrote a check many a check
in the name of a bitch who was strugglin at the same game
all i wanted to do was get paid
just a little somethin for fuckin me
yo everything was cool but vicky concerned me
her husband was the district attorney
so before he found out he was crossed up
by his bitch i was fuckin i had her tossed up
and put to sleep so a nigga never forgets
a dead bitch cant tell a nigga shit
one less bitch you gotta worry about
shes outta here and thats how it turned out

hook mc ren
one less
one less
one less bitch you gotta worry about
verse  dr dre
thinkin about money and lookin at a prostitute
the bitch was cute so now i had to execute
and shoot game like a real nigga
with a steel trigga
convince her to move up to somethin bigga
i think i had a flashback though
cause i said fuck it
loped and choked and smoked to the ho like this
bitch its all about dre
the money money money and this all i gotta say
of course she came with me and remained with me
till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
workin that trick shit
cause niggas knew that she was short one
a little later though she caught one
in the chest and i knew that it was commin
by who and how the all act would be done
so what one less bitch i gotta worry about
but that aint how it turned out

verse  mc ren
yo there was a bitch named her out and shot her
straight to the muthafuckin trigger and said i got her
but i had better plans to give her the blues
like dumpin her in the river with cement shoes
i knew my money was comin up short
and the thought that the stupid bitch thought shed never get caught
came home early and straight bust her ass
on the couch with her other nigga countin my cash
i shouldve known she was like them other hoes
i told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
butt naked nothin left but the shoes
i had up a nine so they couldnt refuse
i shot the nigga he was outta there
and tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin chair
now theres one less bitch i gotta worry about
everybody out thats how it turns out
hook mc ren
one less
one less
one less bitch you gotta worry about

outro eazye
in reality a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
a nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches
and all bitches are created equal
to me all bitches are the same
moneyhungry scandalous groupie hoes
thats always ridin on a niggas dick always in a niggas pocket
and when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind
to me all bitches aint shit

hook mc ren
one less

unlike a lotta suckers who claim theyre gettin busy
when their records only make good frisbees
you need to quit runnin off the mouth
stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
its not difficult in fact its kinda simple
to create something funky thats original
you either talkin bout the place to be
who you are what you got or about a sucker mc

hey you motherfuckers want to step out of the car
dont you know its against the law to play music so god damn loud
shut the fuck up go to jail or gimme that shit you was just smoking

motherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat
and thats some shit you betta not forget

verse  eazye
eazy es the name feared by most
when a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
but on the streets theres two kinds of people
white rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
pull over to the side routine for me
tearin up my shit like they lookin for a key of cocaine
but they never find the shit
aint got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit
thinkin everything is stolen
but cant face facts that a young black niggas just rollin
making more money than they ever make
taking more shit than they ever take
yo pigs are made to kill and no regret and
keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
cause im a nigga that dont give a fuck about nothin
so let me explain a lil somethin yo

see i got this problem a big problem
cops dont like me so i dont like motherfucking cops

hook

episode two
get out of the fuckin car
wait a god damn minute what the hell did i do
hey just shut the fuck up black bitch
wait a minute you aint gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair let
go of my motherfuckin hair
hey just step the fuck back and shut up
get your motherfuckin hands off of me
calm down calm down now listen were gonna go around this corner and
youre gonna suck me and my partners dicks or youre gonna
be one black dead nigga bitch

the doc
police brutality is common in my neighborhood
thats why i hate them motherfuckers

verse  mc ren
i said fuck the police but with a little more force
and maybe now i get my point across
its a massacre goin on just open your eyes and look
everyday a young nigga is took
off the face of the street by a police
its like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
you cant leave out the city that they shacked up
cause if you do thats the right they got you jacked up
its embarassin because you know they justice but all you can do
is say fuck this because if you move thats all she wrote
so whats the excuse to shoot or they rather stomp your head
til youre dead with the steeltoe boot
harassin me with some kind of mind game
actin like a nigga just was born with a gangname
you call that right but when youre black theres no right
some recreational shit was only a gang fight
so shootin at the cops was a street thing
to waste time as we slanged off the cocaine
but everything was done just for peace
to retaliate on the fuckin police so im sayin

hook

the final episode

episode three
hey juan look at the piece of ass man
watch out watch out watch out homes
oh shit man you fucked up you hit a police car

the dayz of wayback lyricsintro
what we gonna do right here is go back

verse  mc ren
now this is some shit thats from the days of wayback
when niggas in compton first started to jack
when the bitches wouldnt give you no pussy
if you wasnt sellin drugs
so many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged
they always loved that shit they want a nigga thats sellin keys
but nowadays they workin at mickey ds
but in the days of wayback i couldnt be laid back
because i needed ends and i made that
i get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
start robbin muthafuckas just like cowboys and indians
anythin it took to get paid
a nigga like ren already had the plan made
and i was in it to win it and not to lose
and shitd start blowin up once i lit the fuse
and police couldnt touch me because i was payin em
but not with no money yo i was sprayin em
and never get caught because nobody is snitch
but one hoe did so ren had to shoot the bitch
now shes in a coffin and my life is better off and
cause everybody knows whos the boss and
that black nigga that they call ren
you fuck with me you gotta fuck with a mac
so listen to me as i reminisce the days of wayback
so check it out yall
verse  dr dre
it was once a time in the days of wayback
when niggas was gettin jacked
in fact it was when i used to pass through the
and kickin ass through a muthafuckin compton massacre
now let me tell you a little somethin about compton
when i was a kid and puttin my bid in
yo compton was like still water  just strictly calm
now its like muthafuckin vietnam
everybody killin tryin to make a killin
niggas stealin muthafuckas willin to dealin
with so many ways to come up
the average nigga didnt give a fuck
about another muthafucka in this game and
claimin what he claimin livin like he livin killin after killin
murder was a dirty job to rob a dead man was the best plan
cause a dead man never ran
but now your best friend is your worst friend
greed kids to feed make a me more some of what you holdin
so now your shit is stolen and you and your niggas start rollin
yo to get your shit back aint the word up
muff its more murder more murder more murder
they wanna make you think that its a crack thang or a black thang
or some niggas in a muthafuckin gang
but guns and money they go together like the ku klux klan
a nigga brung up and strung up
why do i call myself a nigga you ask me
rememberin the days thats past me
yo never givin niggas a chance to rest
the ghetto is like a fuckin survival test
and number one way for you to pass
yo get treated like a king and theyll crown your ass
they never in the wrong though so i made a song so
muthafuckas would know
if your livin situations make you wanna get a gat a gat
thats cause you livin in the dayz of wayback

verse  mc ren
the real niggas is back cause theres too many bullshit records out
niggas fiendin for what we put out
but you dont have to wait no longer
because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
so many groups made three albums or more
and that weakass shit is still sittin in the record store
they wonder why it never sold
niggas rappin since the s and still never went gold
our first record sold two million copies
thats because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
you came out street and crossed over
and after that your career is fuckin over
because of that youre not around
so shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas
interlude eazye
yeah motherfuckers
keepin all you busters on the run in 
kick that shit ren

verse  mc ren
most niggas cant understand
and never will if they aint part of the ruthless mafia clan
niggas is dedicated to the streets
with hype fuckin lyrics and the dopeass beats
the songs will never come soft because i come off
so dont get in my way cause motherfucker youll get cut off
and its somethin you can move your lips to
to wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
and let me now if you wanna ride the dick
all day thats with no play
cause aint no rap group out that i know

all i hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
with lovesongs and that shit is wack
and thats why your ass aint around
cause you dont have the motherfuckin sound

more punks i smoke yo my rep gets bigger
im a bad motherfucker and you know this
but the pussy ass niggas wont show this
but i dont give a fuck ima make my snaps
if not from the records from jackin the crops

and when im illegally armed its called packin
shoot a motherfucker in a minute
i find a good piece of pussy i go up in it
so if youre at a show in the front row
ima call you a bitch or dirtyass ho
youll probably get mad like them bitches are posed to
but that shows me slut youre composed to
a crazy motherfucker from the street
attitude legit cause im tearin up shit
mc ren controls the automatic
for any dumb motherfucker that starts static
not the right hand cause im the hand itself
every time i pull a ak off the shelf
the security is maximum and thats a law
ren spells ren but im raw
see cause im the motherfuckin villain
the definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
thats takin place without a clue
and once youre on the scope your ass is through

eazy is his name and the boy is coming

verse  eazye
straight outta compton is a brother thatll smother your mother
and make your sister think i love her
dangerous motherfucker raising hell
and if i ever get caught i make bail
see i dont give a fuck thats the problem
i see a motherfuckin cop i dont dodge him
but im smart lay low creep a while
and when i see a punk pass i smile
to me its kind of funny the attitudes showin a nigga drivin
but dont know where the fuck he goin just rollin
lookin for the one they call eazy
but heres a flash they never seize me
ruthless never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when i unload you see its about to over the hesitation
and hears the scream of the one who got the last penetration
give a little gust of wind and im jettin
but leave a memory no onell be forgettin

approach to danger lyricsintro eazye
what you want is an unexpected approach
that may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
until you have a chance to assess
the situation you are confronted
approach to danger dont move
its hard to predict what would happen next
oh shit he has a gun drop the gun
you couldve prevented a tragedy

verse  mc ren
you can approach but the danger light is blinkin
a selfdesctruct button is activated when im thinkin
this is a tribulation the weak is judged
the prophecy was fulfilled cause i never budge
i took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
theyre seein doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
one vision was of life the other was death
and life didnt give a fuck if death took your last breath
so you burn in my pit that i call hell
where you got sent because your shit dont sell
my twentytwenty was blurry from the smoke
of the niggas that i burned and tormented but i didnt choke
i started doing them i kept on doing them two of them
shoot them up until that nigga ren was through with them
and my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
but fuck it they can approach to the danger
interlude eazye
if you can be seen you can be hit
if you can be hit you can be killed
hes over there shoot him

verse  dr dre
fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangler
out run the shot of a gun when the games up
murder in the first degree but its worse to be
a dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
with everybody thinkin of death
i kept workin to be one of the last niggas left
so many people lookin for hope they broke
without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfuckers throat
a heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
so figure to see the dead
bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
so its very necessary to carry
ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
before dre goes off
and starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
anger for the real nigga when i approach to danger

interlude
approach the motherfuckin danger
come back to hell and see me some time
this is it yall
verse  eazye
final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
but even the rain turns black
all you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
no prison nobody makes bail
everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
think about death takin your last breath
heart beatin like a motherfucker like it aint no time left
with so many ways to stay up i gotta get mine
even though they wanna make a crime yo
of bein real a federal letter in the beginnin
because of the release of fuck the police
fuck it i approach the danger
cause i dont give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up
so you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
cause in the long run we all dieembed

verse  dr dre
first come first serve whoevers got the nerve
step up and get what you deserve

brainiac so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
now how the fuck you think that rap would last
wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
yo be original your shit is sloppy
get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
verse  mc ren
falling deep in the drums of so many of styles
is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
cheating and not beating the crowd i kept seating
but weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
styles that kept them full of bull
cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
they got the nerve to cuss
only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

verse  dr dre
yo giving what i gotta give doing what i gotta do
you dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
you cant harm me alarm me
cause were the generals in this fucking hiphop army

cause a nigga like rens only two steps behind ya
dont look back cause youre shaking and all scared
a nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
so sleep wit the lights on forget that the mics on
dont step on my muthafucking stage without nikes on
dont say its psycho and then you just might go
mentally fucked up when i get the right flow
verse  dr dre
all these niggas with the jibber jabber
but couldnt kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
gangstas in black are out there
but only because yo its the shit we wear
on my muthafucking dick
but im a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
so yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
you get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead

verse  eazye  mc ren
back the good the bad the ugly you see
a little streetwise nigga you know me
rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps
but you muthafuckas know who run the streets
with that hardcore hiphop rap shit
now how much harder can another nigga get
trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
ashes to ashes and dust to dust
so nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
cause im a muthafucka thats out to kill
eazye a nigga thats real

interlude dj yella

one nigga left and they said we aint happening

donald b in the place to give me the pace
he said my man jd is on freebase
the boy jd was a friend of mine

and from the ball my breath start stinkin
love to get my girl to rock that body
before i left i hit the bacardi
went to her house to get her out of the pad
dumb h says somethin that made me mad
she said somethin that i couldnt believe
so i grabbed the stupid  by her nappy ass weave
she started talkin  wouldnt you know
reached back like a pimp and slapped the h
her father jumped out and he started to shout

goin off on a motherfer like that
with a gat thats pointed at yo a
so give it up smooth
aint no tellin when im down for a jack move
heres a murder rap to keep yo dancin
with a crime record like charles manson
ak is the tool
dont make me act the motherfin fool

im knockin nz out tha box daily
yo weekly monthly and yearly
until them dumb motherfers see clearly
that im down with the capital cpt

more punks i smoke yo my rep gets bigger
im a bad motherfer and you know this
but the p a nz wont show this
but i dont give a f ima make my snaps
if not from the records from jackin the crops
just like burglary the definition is jackin
and when illegally armed its called packin
shoot a motherfer in a minute
i find a good piece o p and go up in it
so if youre at a show in the front row
im a call you a b or dirtyass ho
youll probably get mad like a b is supposed to
but that shows me slut youre composed to
a crazy muthafer from tha street
attitude legit cause im tearin up s
mc ren controls the automatic
for any dumb muthafer that starts static
not the right hand cause im the hand itself
every time i pull a ak off the shelf
the security is maximum and thats a law
ren spells ren but im raw
see coz im the motherfin villain
the definition is clear youre the witness of a killin
thats takin place without a clue
and once youre on the scope your a is through
look you might take it as a trip
but a n like ren is on a gangsta tip
straight outta compton
chorus
city of compton city of compton
dr dre eazy is his name and the boy is comin

verse three eazye
straight outta compton
is a brotha thatll smother yo mother
and make ya sister think i love her
dangerous motherfer raises hell
and if i ever get caught i make bail
see i dont give a f thats the problem
i see a motherfin cop i dont dodge him
but im smart lay low creep a while
and when i see a punk pass i smile
to me its kinda funny the attitude showin a n drivin
but dont know where the f hes going just rollin
lookin for the one they call eazy
but heres a flash they never seize me
ruthless never seen like a shadow in the dark
except when i unload see ill get over the hesitation
and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration
give a little gust of wind and im jettin
but leave a memory no onell be forgettin
so what about the b who got shot f her
you think i give a damn about a b i aint a sucka
this is the autobiography of the e and if you ever f with me
youll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother

real niggaz new version lyrics a different version than all previous releases

intro dj yella
every motherfucker always asks how did nwa get started
we dont know how it got started
fuck that question you know what im saying
its the same bullshit over and over
how did we get started
how did we first meet

mc ren
prisoner like a hostage
yo you shouldve covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
deep in the dirt cause you was a sucker
and your ass up high so i can kick the motherfucker
dont try to hang you best avoid it
cause my foot will be so far up your ass youll get hemrroids
before you try to fuck with ren
ill put two in your ass and youll be shitting the size 
dr dre
first come first serve whoevers got the nerve
step up and get what you deserve
from the world of the motherfucking hiphop maniac
brainiac so what you ought to do is step the fuck back
but how the fuck you think your rap would last
with your ass saying shit that is said in the past
yo be original your shit is sloppy
get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy

mc ren
falling deep in the drums for many of styles
is one of the reasons a nigga ran the hundred miles
cheating and not beating the crowd are kept seating
but weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
styles that kept them full of bull
cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
and got the nerve to cuss
only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us

dr dre
yo giving what i gotta give doing what i gotta do
you dont care for me so who gives a fuck about you
you cant harm me alarm me
cause were the generals in this fucking hiphop army
the niggas with attitudes if you didnt know
we blow flow and then move slow from the get go
yo tie us to take it
yo fuck this shit yella kick the break in
chorus eazye
its the real thing
you are now    dr dre
real real niggas niggas

mc ren
you can run but you cant hide you know im a find you
cause a nigga like ren is only two steps behind you
dont look back because youre shaking and all scared
a nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
so sleep with the lights on forget that the mics on
dont step on my motherfucking stage without nikes on
dont say its psycho and then you just might go
mentally fucked up when i let the right blow

dr dre
all these niggas with the gibber gabber
but couldnt kill a fly with a motherfucking sledge hammer
gangsters in black are out there
but only because yo its the shit that we wear
on my motherfucking dick
but ima love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
so yo step off go to bed cause if youre mislead
youll get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead

eazye
black the good the bad the ugly you see
a little street wise nigga you know me
rolling with some real niggas playing for keeps
but you motherfuckers know who run the streets
with that hardcore hiphop rap shit
mc ren now how much harder can another nigga get
trying to be like us sound like us dress like us
mc ren ashes to ashes and dust to dust
so nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga please
since youre on the dick why dont you drop to your knees
cause im the motherfucker thats out to kill
eazye a nigga thats real

so brace yourself to make sure you dont get fucked up
because if i let you slide its just cause you lucked up
dont come in my face again because im a floor you
and if youre a bitch ima fucking ignore you
because my attitude is a little bigger
cause mc ren is one of the real niggas

dr dre
lost in a motherfucking world of madness
sadness but dre is just a nigga that gladdest
sucking motherfuckers like you making whack jams
because it only shows you how dope i am
never try to ignore us
when im expressing standstill like youre full of rigor mortis
cause im a real nigga but i guess you figure
you can break me take me but watch me pull the trigger
dre is just a nigga with heart a nigga thats smart
a nigga thats paid to say what others are scared to play

so im glad we got rid of benedict arnold

cause im frisked with my hands on a hot hood
and gettin jacked by the youknowwho
when in a black and white the capacity is two
were not alone were three more brothers i mean streetbrothers
not wearing medallions cause we aint going out like suckers
theyre out to take our heads for what we said in the past
and thats the reason why ren is running fast
i didnt stutter when i said forget tha police
cause its hard for a brother to get peace
now its broken and cant be fixed
cause police and a kid from the ghetto dont mix so
now im creepin through the fall
runnin like a team well see i might have slayed yall
so for now pack the gun and
hold it in the air cause mc ren has a  miles of runnin
interlude
into this news four fugitives are on the run
fbi sources tell us that the four are headed
 miles to their homebase compton

break dr dre  eazye
shut up and lend me an ear
so i can tell you why

verse  dr dre
runnin with my brothers headed for the homebase
with a steady pace on the face that just we raced
the road ahead goes on and on
it even seems like its gettin longer than a marathon
runnin on but never runnin out
stayin wired and if i get tired i can still try out
hitchhikin if thats what it gotta do
but nobodys pickin up a brother witta attitude
confused yo but dres never had nothin to lose
one of the few whos been accused and abused
of the crime of poisonin young minds
but you dont know nothin til you been in my shoes
and dre is back from the cpt
droppin some tracks thats dope
so laid upon the police
and anybody else that disagrees
stuck and runnin hard moving fast
cause i been a brother known for havin a notorious past
my mind was slick  my temper was too quick
now the fbis all over my stick
verse  eazye
got the stick and runnin just to find the gun that started the clock
thats when the e jumped off the startin block
a  miles from home and yo its a long stretch
a little sprintin young brother that they wont catch
yeah back to compton again
yo its either that or the federal pen
cause brothers been runnin since beginning of time
takin a minute just to tell you whats on my mind
runnin like i just dont care
comptons  miles but yo imma get there
archin my back and on a straight rough
just like carl lewis im ballin the hell out
from city to city im a menace as i pass by
rippin up things just so you can remember im
a straight up brother thats done in gunnin and comin
straight up homeboy a  miles and runnin

interlude
this one goes out to the four brothers from compton
youre almost there but the fbi has a little message for you
nowhere to run to baby nowhere to hide
good luck brothers

verse  mc ren
running for my life i hate to lose
show me on the news but i hate to be abused
i know it was a setup  so now im gonna get up
even if the fbi wants me to shut up
but ive got   brothers strong
and as long as i got run fast from the police song
they treat my group like dirt
while their whole damn family is wearin our tshirts
so imma run til i cant run no more
cause its time for mc ren to settle the score
i got a urge to kick down doors
at my grave like a slave even if the ren calls
verse  dr dre
clouds are dark and brothers are hidin
and its funny cause all these stupid suckers are riding
we started with five and yo one couldnt take it
so now theres four cause the fifth couldnt make it
the numbers even  now im leavin
were never gettin took by a woman with a weave in
her and the troops are right behind me
but theyre so stupid theyll never find me

verse  eazye
one more mile to go through the dark streets
runnin like a tired brother on my own two feet
but you know i never stumble or lag last
im almost home so i better run fast
tearin up everything in sight
its a little crazy young brother dodging the searchlight
now that chase is stopped and done and
four young brothers goin crazy with
a  miles of runnin

stop stop stop stopembed

fuck the police  kakuda lyricsright about now nwa court is in full effect

fuck the police coming straight from the underground
a young nigga got it bad cause im brown
and not the other color so police think
they have the authority to kill a minority
fuck that shit cause i aint the one
for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
to be beating on and thrown in jail
we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
fucking with me cause im a teenager
a little bit of gold and a pager
searching my car looking for the product
thinking every nigga is selling narcotics
youd rather see me in the pen
than me and lorenzo rollin in a benzo
beat a police out of shape
and when im finished bring the yellow tape
to tape off the scene of the slaughter
still getting swole off bread and water
i dont know if they fags or what
search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
and on the other hand without a gun they cant get none
but dont let it be a black and a white one
cause theyll slam ya down to the street top
black police showing out for the white cop
ice cube will swarm
on any motherfucker in a blue uniform
just cause im from the cpt
punk police are afraid of me
huh a young nigga on the warpath
and when im finished its gonna be a bloodbath
of cops dying in la
yo dre i got something to say
fuck the police x

example of scene one

cop pull your goddamn ass over right now
nwa aww shit now what the fuck you pulling me over for
cop cause i feel like it just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
nwa man fuck this shit
cop aight smartass im taking your black ass to jail

dr dre
mc ren will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fuckedup incident

mc ren
fuck the police and ren said it with authority
because the niggas on the street is a majority
a gang is with whoever im stepping
and the motherfucking weapon is kept in
a stash box for the socalled law
wishing ren was a nigga that they never saw
lights start flashing behind me
but theyre scared of a nigga
so they mace me to blind me
but that shit dont work i just laugh
because it gives em a hint not to step in my path
for police im saying fuck you punk
reading my rights and shit its all junk
pulling out a silly club so you stand
with a fakeass badge and a gun in your hand
but take off the gun so you can see whats up
and well go at it punk and imma fuck you up
make you think imma kick your ass
but drop your gat and rens gonna blast
im sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
but imma smoke em now and not next time
smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
or any asshole that threatens me
im a sniper with a hell of a scope
taking out a cop or two they cant cope with me
the motherfucking villain thats mad
with potential to get bad as fuck
so imma turn it around
put in my clip yo and this is the sound
yeah something like that
but it all depends on the size of the gat
taking out a police would make my day
but a nigga like ren dont give a fuck to say
fuck the police x

nwa yeah man what you need
cop police open now
nwa aww shit
cop we have a warrant for eazyes arrest
cop get down and put your hands up where i can see em move motherfucker move now

dr dre
eazye wont you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit

eazye
im tired of the motherfucking jacking
sweating my gang while im chilling in the shack and
shining the light in my face and for what
maybe its because i kick so much butt
i kick ass or maybe cause i blast
on a stupidass nigga
when im playing with the trigger
of an uzi or an ak
cause the police always got something stupid to say
they put out my picture with silence
cause my identity by itself causes violence
the e with the criminal behavior
yeah im a gangster but still i got flavor
without a gun and a badge what do ya got
a sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
by me or another nigga
and with a gat it dont matter if hes smaller or bigger
mc ren size aint shit hes from the old school fool
and as you all know es here to rule
whenever im rolling keep looking in the mirror
and ears on cue yo so i can hear a
dumb motherfucker with a gun
and if im rolling off the  hell be the one
that i take out and then get away
while im driving off laughing this is what ill say

express yourself edited lyricsintro dr dre  ice cube
dr dre yo man its a lot of brothers out there flakin and perpetratin but scared to kick reality
ice cube man youve been doin all this dope producing but you aint had a chance to show em what time it is
dr dre so what you want me to do  express yourself

verse  dr dre
im expressing with my full capabilities
and now im living in correctional facilities
cause some dont agree with how i do this
i get straight meditate like a buddhist
im dropping flavor my behavior is hereditary
but my technique is very necessary
blame it on ice cube because he says it gets funky
when you got a subject and a predicate
add it on a dope beat and itll make you think
some suckers just tickle me pink
to my stomach cause they dont flow like this one
you know what i wont hesitate to diss one
or two before im through so dont try to sing this
some drop science well im dropping english
even if yella makes it a cappella
i still express yo i dont smoke weed or sess
cause its known to give a brother brain damage
and brain damage on the mic dont manage nothing
but making a sucker and you equal dont be another sequel
hook
express yourself

come on and do it

verse  dr dre
now getting back to the pg
thats program and its easy
dre is back new jacks are made hollow
expressing aint their subject because they like to follow
the words the style the trend the records i spin
again and again and again yo you on the other end
watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
theres no fessing and guessing while im expressing myself
its crazy to see people be
what society wants them to be but not me
ruthless is the way to go they know
others say rhymes that fail to be original
or they kill where the hiphop starts
forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
some musicians curse at home
but scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
yeah they want reality but you wont hear none
they rather exaggerate a little fiction
some say no to drugs and take a stand
but after the show they go looking for the dopeman
or they ban my group from the radio hear nwa and say hell no
but you know it aint all about wealth as long as you make a note to
hook
express yourself
express yourself
come on and do it

verse  dr dre
express yourself from the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
then expression is a big part of it
you aint efficient when you flow
you aint swift moving like a tortoise full of rigor mortis
theres a little bit more to show
i got rhymes in my mind embedded like an embryo
or a lesson all of em expression
and if you start fessing i got a smith and wesson for you
i might ignore your record because it has no bottom
i get loose in the summer winter spring and autumn
its dre on the mic getting physical
doing the job nwa is the lynch mob
yes im macabre but you know you need this
and the knowledge is growing just like a foetus
or a tumor but heres the rumor
dre is in the neighbourhood and hes up to no good
when i start expressing myself yella slam it
cause if i stay funky like this im doing damage
or ima be too hyped and need a straight jacket
i got knowledge and other suckers lack it
so when you see dre a dj on the mic
ask what its like its like we getting hype tonight
cause if i strike it aint for your good health
but i wont strike if you just

parental discretion iz advised clean lyricsintro the doc
ayo dre whats goin on man whats goin on
ay what chyall gon do for this last record
nah tell me what chyall gon do
okay you want me to do the intro aight
parental discretion is advised for the moment
while im getting candid now understand it
aint too typical in any way though the pro
on the mic is the do to the c this is an intro
i know the doc makes you want to take a valium
so buy a bucket cause upcoming is my album
and for the record meaning my record check it
listen to the single and youll be like yo i gotta get it
but in the meantime listen to the rhyme
of the dr dre played with nwa
yellas on the drum roll rocking the beat
ayo dre wheres you gonna take this  man
verse  dr dre the doc
ayo lets take it to the street word up
let em understand perfection
let knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessing
cause i dont give a damn about a radio play
observe the english i display
lyrics for the adults children have been barred
and scarred from listening to something so censored hard
dope pumping thats so my rhymes will never falter
yo its dre forget the mind of minolta
psycho like no other dumb brother
so step to me wrong go for what you no
but be warned never will i leave like a regular
cause im a little better than the regular competitor
i use to see em on stage
earning money like a thief but without a gauge
until i got full of clocking the lame getting pull
they said you wasnt gon get paid
nah thats bull yo they like it stylistic
and i enchant the crowd like im a mystic
cccc ccccameras are flashing when im in action
a photo or fresh with a flair for fashion
pure simplicity see its elementary
you hear one of the hardest young brothers this century
try to comprise a word to the wise and the guys
parental discretion is advised
verse  mc ren
ren is most extremely high performance
the black hat cause i worn this cause its like enormous
some trash i dont take it not even in a toilet
and trash from a sucker put in a pot and ill boil it
turn up the pilot as it burns
and maybe the stupid suckersll learn
im not a sub cause i speak sensible
not considered a prince cause im a principal
im engineering the funky sound that youre hearing
cause when it comes to power im power steering
silly you say i say youre silly when you say it
rushing to the eject to put my tape in and play it
its like apollo but im not an amateur
and i really dont care while im damaging ya
its for the record yo so my lyrics is gonna spin it
and if there was a trophy involved id win it
possession is mine and im the holder
cause a brother like ren dont really care cause im older
so for you to step off would be wise
and say forget it parental discretion is advised

verse  ice cube
i be what is known as a bandit
you gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
cause if you fail to see read it in braille
itll still be funky so whats next is the flex
of a genius my rapidstutterstepping if you seen this
dope you hope that i dont really mean this
but if play made a greater hightop fade
its not my trademark when i get loose in the dark
you guess it was a test of a different style
its just another dope brother on the pile
driving around with the flow of the tongue
you hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung
to your attention by the hardest rapping artist
that is known for lynching any sucker in a minute
stagger em all
when i start flowing like niagara falls
ice cube is equipped to rip it up in a battle
move like a snake when im mad and then my tail rattle
i get low on the flow so let your kids know
when i bust parental discretion is a must
verse  eazye
little did they know that i would be arriving
and its surprising rocking it from where i been
but its the e here to take no mistake to be made
in the trade where funky dope records are being played
damn the regular yo as i get better the
girls wanna trick and go stupid up on the tip
so i get em hot thinking theyre gonna get it
as they sit rubbing their legs like a cricket
to you it may be funny but
theres no service of beef without money
so slip the cnote and you can choke
on a wingdingdingaling down your throat
foreplay to me aint it
when you spread em im ready then you can get a hit
from the eaze if you can deal with the size but if you cant

i punch you can block it but ima still get in
this aint a tko in the first
but its some lyrics from a villain in black and much worse
than a beating from tyson cause ren is not nice and
you know youre better off just rolling a dice and
finding you a number for luck seven
cause you will need it when you see i dont give a f
my identity and the rap is getting shown word
without a video im still getting known
im at a show then my picture is taken yeah
one click of the flash and all the suckers are breakin
to the door tryin to join my fan club
lipsyncin over one of my dubs
an instrumental will scratch for the moment for the moment
until i dog out the so called opponent
thats standing in the zone of the twilight twilight
saying how in the hell did he get mixed up in my fight
it wasnt a mistake it was a setup
so until im finished pumpin my lyrics you should shut up
and dont attempt to speak yeah
because its bad enough youre rollin up my creek
with a brother like ren about the hit

comptons in the house but now its some longer

lyrics

chorus

fuck the police fuck fuck fuck the police
fuck them motherfuckers
fuck fuck fuck the police
get paid back youre motherfucking right yo
verse one dr dre

fuck the motherfucking police
they dont want peace they want a nigga deceased
so hell cease to be a problem and by the way the perform
it seems the klan gave the white police another uniform
and yo the black police the house niggas
they gave you a motherfucking gun so i guess you figure
you made out good to go but you didnt know
they would stick your black ass back in the ghetto yo
to kill another nigga catch him with crack in fact
freebase  they put in the neighborhood in the first place
but the brothers aint stupid remember that
you got a gat i got a gat so whassup with that
a to the motherfuckin k
the last words you hear then the smoke appears
tears from your motherfuckin family
theyre starin at me but im goin gun happy fuck em
shootin everything in sight tonights the night to get hyped
and fight for whats wrong fuck whats right
and by the way my name is dre
so listen up motherfucker to what i gotta say yo

intro 

chorus
fuck the police fuck fuck fuck the police
fuck
fuck fuck fuck the police
now for the first episode

verse two eazye

eazy es the name feared by most
when a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
but on the streets theres two kinds of people
white rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
pull over to the side routine for me
tearin up my shit like they lookin for a key of cocaine
but they never find the shit
aint got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit
thinkin everything is stolen
but cant face facts that a young black niggas just rollin
making more money than they ever make
taking more shit than they ever take
yo pigs are made to kill and no regret and
keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
cause im a nigga that dont give a fuck about nothin
so let me explain a lil somethin yo

intro 

see i got this problem a big problem
cops dont like me so i dont like motherfucking cops
chorus

fuck the police fuck fuck fuck the police
fuck
fuck fuck fuck the police
fuck the police

police brutality is common in my neighborhood
thats why i hate them motherfuckers

verse three mc ren

i said fuck the police but with a little more force
and maybe now i get my point across
its a lot here thats goin on just open your eyes and look
everyday a young nigga is took
off the face of the street by a police
its like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
you cant leave out the city that they shacked up
cause if you do thats the right they got you jacked up
its embarassin because you know they justice but all you can do
is say fuck this because if you move thats all she wrote
so what the excuse to shoot or they rather stomp your head
til youre dead with the steel toe boot
harassin me with some kind of mind game
actin like a nigga just was born with a gangname
you call that right but when youre black theres no right
some recreational shit was only a gang fight
so shootin at the cops was a street thing
to waste time have to explain dont do cocaine
but everything was done just for peace
to retaliate on the fuckin police so im sayin

chorus

fuck the police fuck fuck fuck the police
fuck
fuck the police fuck fuck the policeembed
it aint ruff lyricsmc ren
ren is the villain and youre just an hostage
so whenever im steppin cover your head like an ostrich
groupies been waitin for this suckers been hatin for this
you know why  because so many are relatin to this
jealous is how they feel it intentionally
but they start to love it becoz i made it eventually
pumpin the music i keep the music like pumpin
coz ren aint in here for nuthin i keep the average crowd jumpin
yo you know the color the villains in black
always down to make noise and attack
so you better get back unless you wanna come with it
and make your face like a target and close your eyes when i hit it
youre screamin with fear but its with fear that youre screamin
youre wakin up in a sweat coz ren is givin bad dreams and
im not schemin im just tellin the facts
thats how it is when nwa starts to jack
so brothers that wanna scrp with me
that sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me
especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
i just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
coz when it comes to ren theres no comparison
and if you try to be me its quite embarassin
but i understand coz youre mentally slow
coz i can tell from the jump youre too nervous to go
if it aint ruff it aint me scratch
tha gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me scratch
lemme bust a freestyle here allright then
i can tell that youre afraid to fight me
simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
becoz youre sweat as a puddle but theres a puddle o sweat
im a threath so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
and clean the dirt off your face that calls acne
its ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
this is the round where the punch will go
until ya a gat thats known as a flow
im makin a point but its a point that im makin
like see im hatin the fakin i keep the suckers like shakin
scared to speak with a tongue and theyre chozen
the sound of my voice in their ear and theyre frozen
this is a battle to the death its like the  same ol 
against a brother on a tip with 
givin a pain but its with pain that im givin
but im comparin and tearinem but im makin a livin
with the hype of a  volt battery
and the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
meanin im a flow
im from the streets so yo im ready to go
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
tha gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me
man whatcha gonna do now  get funky
the do not disturb sign is in effect
while im thinkin of a fool to select
to give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then i kick them
tellem theyre guilty and beep out the bailer
and get a new track o drums so i can play with
percussion pumpin it loud when i perform
yo you wanna play in my game put on a uniform
it aint a rule in the book you have to go by
hey coz when it comes to cheatin yo you should know i
for fear in the hearts coz its the hearts full of fear
coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
the hump was incredible yo but ren he was super
but now im ruthless a civilian and not a trooper
but a soldier with a top rankin
givin dope material the hell with the gankin
so play like an airplane and just jet
and keep your blood pressure low coz im a  if not
im afraid of the show
that youre a sucker and youre too nervous to go
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
the gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
the gangstas black if it aint  if it aint

ren is the villain and youre just a hostage
so whenever im steppin cover your head like an ostrich
groupies been waitin for this suckers been hatin for this
you know why
cause so many are relatin to this
jealous is how they feelin intentionally
but they start to love it because i made it eventually
pumpin the music i keep the music like pumpin
cause ren aint in here for nothin i keep the average crowd jumpin
yo you know the colour the villains in black
always down to make noise and attack
so you better get back unless you wanna come with it
and make your face like a target and close your eyes when i hit it
youre screamin with fear but its with fear that youre screamin
youre wakin up in a sweat cause ren is givin bad dreams and
im not schemin im just tellin the facts
thats how it is when nwa starts to jack
so brothers that wanna scrap with me
that sweezin and sneezin will have to lap with me
especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
i just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
cause when it comes to ren theres no comparison
and if you try to be me its quite embarrassin
but i understand cause youre mentally slow
cause i can tell from the jump youre too nervous to go
hook 
if it aint ruff it aint me scratching noise
the gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me scratching noise
lemme bust a freestyle thenalright bet

verse  mc ren
i can tell that youre afraid to fight me
simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
because your sweat is a puddle but theres a puddle o sweat
im a threat so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
and clean the dirt off your face that causes acne
its ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
this is the round where the punch will go
into your head thats known as a blow
im makin a point but its a point that im makin
like see im hatin the fakin i keep the suckers like shakin
scared to speak with a thought when theyre chosen
the sound of my voice in their ear and theyre frozen
this is a battle to the death its like the same ol
against a brother on a tip with a kangol
givin a pain but its with pain that im givin
but im comparin and tearin em but im makin a livin
with the hype of a nine volt battery
and the odds for me to conquer is averagely
good meanin imma flow
im from the streets so yo im ready to go
hook 
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
tha gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me
man whatchya gonna do now get funky

verse  mc ren
the do not disturb sign is in effect
while im thinkin of a fool to select
to give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then i kick them
tell em theyre guilty and peep out the bailer
and get a new track o drums so i can play with
percussion pumpin it loud when i perform
yo you wanna play in my game put on a uniform
it aint a rule in the book you have to go by
hey cause when it comes to cheatin yo you should know i
for fear in the hearts cause its the hearts full of fear
cause what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
the hulk was incredible yo but ren he was super
but now im ruthless a civilian and not a trooper
but a soldier with a top rankin
givin dope material the hell with the gankin
so play like an airplane and just jet
and keep your blood pressure low cause im a threat cause if not
im afraid of the show
that youre a sucker and youre too nervous to go
hook 
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
the gangstas black and hes about to attack
if it aint ruff it aint me yo ren
the gangstas black if it aint if it aint

appetite for destruction west coast classics lyricsverse  dr dre
i got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
murder i heard herâwhenâshe screamed theâdrop
cause her son caught the slug
relateâthis to no choice
and listen to this straightup man before they ban the voice
while i rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
whoever said that what i say and portray is negativity
need to come kick it in the city with me
and find the black and crack de fact
and take that shit back
cause they dont wanna fuck with that
theres too many niggas theyre tryin to calm
if mothafuckaz could get it nobody wouldve fuck with it
appetite for destruction
for him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
murder in the first degree and manslaughter
takin the life of his wife and young daughter
a whole city of bitches that look sucked up
and the niggas is killin its straight fucked up
whoever sayin what im sayin is for greed
then i aint even what theyre tryin to feed
my appetite for destruction
you guys know who im talkin to

verse  mc ren
the appetite is tremendous so im gonna spin this
drop up some violence because they ask me to end this
some trouble that i cought cause i was noisy
a nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
he took a swing for my head thought i was faded
start runnin for the door but the fucker never made it
the sound of the  went bang
and all over the wall was his mothafuckin brain
cause im a nigga you cant sleep on
so set the alarm cause i hit like a mothafuckin bomb
i do damage with the  in my hand
but the average nigga that dont know me dont understand
im from the streets so therefore
you know i dont care for a sucker that aint down
with the real niggas the niggas the niggas
yo and after when the shit gotta go aint even sober
any time that the  wanna leave
i got a  hidden up the sleeve
and its ready to go to war cause thats what its here for
i shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
and thats the million and one they couldnt hang with the appetite cause they wasnt rappin right
so i had to destroy whoever was standin in my presence
for fuckin up the essence  appetite for destruction

i possess the  commandments of the hiphop thugsta
known as the thief and murderer

second one  always gotta fuck out of wedlock
i like it when the pussy goes snap crackle and pop
number three  im a gangsta fanatic

number eight  make no mistake

ninth one  i gotta be raw

approach to danger edited lyricswhat you want is an unexpected approach
that may delay a suspects awareness of your presence
until you have a chance to assess
the situation you are confronted
approach to danger dont move
its hard to predict what would happen next
oh s he has a gun drop the gun
you couldve prevented a tragedy
you can approach but the danger light is blinkin
a selfdestruct button is activated when im thinkin
this is a tribulation the weak is judged
the prophecy was fulfilled cause i never budge
i took up the tools crucifixion was the extreme
theyre seein doubles of me but it wasnt a dream
one vision was of life the other was death
and life didnt give a  if death took your last breath
so you burn in my pit that i call hell
where you got sent because your  dont sell
my  was blurry from the smoke
of the  that i burned and tormented but i didnt choke
i started doin em i kept on doin em
two of em shoot em up til that  ren was through with em
and my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
but  it they can approach to the danger
if you can be seen you can be hit
if you can be hit you can be killed
hes on the line shoot him
fatal approach to danger just to remain a strangler
out run the shot of a gun when the games up
murder in the first degree but its worse to be
a dead motherf or a  in custody
with everybody thinkin of death
i kept workin to be one of the last n left
so many people lookin for hope they broke
without checkin the fingerprints on a motherf throat
a heart of steel can reveal the real  in me
so figure to see the d e a d
bodies like a  straight walkin in a cemetery
so its very necessary to carry
ammunition for  wishin but they better take caution
before dre goes off
and starts killin motherf just in order to change the
anger for the real  when i approach to danger
approach the motherf danger
come back to hell and see me some time
this is it yall
final approach to danger death destruction around every corner
another dead body and you wanna keep runnin
but even the day turns black
all you can do is stay alert and try to stay out of the searchlight
no prison nobody makes bail
everybody gotta go but see it aint no jail
think about death takin your last breath
heart beatin like a motherf like it aint no time left
with so many ways to stay up i gotta get mine
even though they wanna make a crime yo
of bein real a federal letter in the beginnin
because of the release of f tha police
 it i approach the danger
cause i dont give a  if somebody gotta get  up
so you might as well kiss your ass goodbye
cause in the long run we all dieembed
