      "redder blood \n",
      "\n",
      "the most prominent and respected man in new york twenty-five years ago was stanton birch. he was thirty-four, and he possessed a mind, good looks, and riches.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was nothing with which he was not conversant, and concerning many things he had a profound knowledge. art, history, science, invention, fiction, womenâ€”with all these things he was more or less familiar. if he had entered any of the several clubs of which he was a member,â€”the albion, the gilbo, the east end athletic,â€”while a controversy was going on in which neither participant was willing to admit that he was wrong, they would have exclaimed, \"here's birch; let him settle the dispute.\" and so much did they honor him that whatever he said was accepted ex cathedra and the disputations ended. yet he was not a \"man of the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he knew women and liked them; but he detested the mothers that were ever sending him invitations in order \"to catch\" him because he was unmarried, unrelated, and wealthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "he did not even care for their \"join us tonight at wallack's, box i,\" to see modjeska, ellen terry, mac cullough, or jefferson. the invitations generally came from persons who were narrow, devoid of artistic sense, or unappreciative. he sometimes accepted them, however, because he was sociable, and he could not ignore kindnesses even though they were often shams or subterfuges.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was not a charity organization in new york that had not his name on the list of its contributors, and he always responded to such appeals with liberal donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "but his pastime and his hobby were horses, and the trainer and owner of the most fashionable riding-school in the city said that he was the best horseman he had ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a striking figure one bright morning late in november as he rode down fifth avenue on his superbly caparisoned arabian mare and turned at seventy-second street into central park.\n",
      "\n",
      "the air had in it a crispness that was enlivening, a freshness that was energy-creating. with her head high in the air, her eyes spirited, her ears vacillating, and her step lively, the mare might easily have had her prototype in one of besnard's sleek, lifelike animals jaunting over a red, sunlit moroccan hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "he rode her at a good gallop through the park until he came to sixty-fifth street, near the animal cages, and then suddenly a cry went up.\n",
      "\n",
      "he saw men, women, and children running like savages, making the strangest and most hideous noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "turning, he saw not far distant from him and approaching with accelerating speed a firey-eyed lion that had broken loose from one of the cages.\n",
      "\n",
      "the imperturbability that he always possessed did not forsake him, so he put spurs to the horse. this he thought his only hope, but the mare had already been terrified by the roars of the oncoming beast, and she ran wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "before him seemingly lay two paths to death, if he could not fight out some way of escape. the lion, approaching him from behind, would tear him into bits; the mare, if he could not drop from the saddle unhurt, with her mad, reckless running, would be very likely to throw him against a tree or stone and dash his brains out.\n",
      "\n",
      "he quickly drew the reins to turn the mare behind a hedge, but by his sudden drawing of the reins he turned her into a park bench, which she had to jump. her front feet went over like those of a trained fox-chasing animal, but the hind ones hung on the bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "she went down, and stanton birch was thrown against a huge tree. the wild beast, alarmed, did not stop for the fallen prey, but kept on across to eighth avenue and through sixty-fourth street.\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the park employees ran to the spot where the mare had gone down; there lay the rider limp and unconscious, and the. mare with a broken leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "as the fallen man was lifted up, some one said, \"my god! it's mr. stanton birch.\" every park employee knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "the man felt stanton birch's pulse. it moved faint and weak. \"send for an ambulance,\" he commanded; \"he's still alive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "from his pocket he took a flask of whiskey,â€” one could not vouch for its quality,â€”and forced a little of it down mr. birch's throat to warm him until the ambulance should come.\n",
      "\n",
      "in a few minutes the big red hospital wagon from bellevue arrived and took him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "in those exciting moments news of this accident had spread rapidly throughout the city; every paper in town had an extra. publishers and newsboys are always glad when something happens to a personage.\n",
      "\n",
      "over the whole city one could hear their yells: \"extree! extree ! stanton boirch hoirt,\"â€”\"extree! extree ! stanton boirch almost kilt by accident wid 'his hossl git 'em here; two cents a coppee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "as fast as the driver could he rushed the unconscious man to the hospital on twenty-sixth street.\n",
      "\n",
      "an examination showed that the blow had produced a blood clot in the cerebrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "every noted brain specialist and surgeon was sent for at once. an immediate consultation was held; undelayed action was imperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "scientific surgery was then in its incipiency; even the most experienced surgeon would attempt so serious an operation with the gravest fear. it required the most masterful piece of trephining; one little mistake meant death, yet it was the only hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "the operating table was put in order, and the unconscious man was placed upon it. his skull was opened, and the wielder of the sharp instruments moved them with skillful accuracy. around him stood the other surgeons, with faces serious, â€”hopeful,â€”anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "pretty young girls upon whom he might have cast a meaningless smile heard of the accident and hoped sincerely for his recovery. \"who knows?\" they soliloquized. \"i may yet win his heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the old darky head-waiter at the albion club ceased praying for the blessings of the deity on himself and his family and now supplicated him to restore to health \"missah boirch, 'cause he sho is a good man.\" he knew that mr. birch's life meant fifteen or twenty dollars a week more to him. the directors of the charity institutions were in a quandary; whether they would rather have him die and thus take a chance on what he might will them or whether his yearly donations to them meant more was a problem that required close calculation; but they too concluded that it would he better to hope for his recovery than to assume an indifferent air. whether he died or not was immaterial to them so long as they were remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i believe the operation will be successful,\" remarked dr. post, the head surgeon, with confidence, when he had finished. the expression on all their faces became less tense, more hopeful, more confident. \"send for miss marston,\" the doctor continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"she's the pretty, black-haired nurse, is she?\" asked dr. munn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"without an equal to my knowledge,\" answered dr. post, looking hopefully at the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "a young lady of twenty,â€”with widely set, tender, generous, expressive eyes, â€” entered. a sprightly little smile played around her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"miss marston,\" began dr. post, \"this is a very serious case and one that requires the utmost care; that's why i sent for you. . . .you are not to leave his bedside until orders come from me. i'll give you an attendant to wait on you. if you notice any change, if he seems to regain consciousness, notify one of the surgeons at once. you understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i think so, sir,\" she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"then i may trust you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'll do the best i can,\" she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "the doctors turned and left the room, and miss marston went about her work with more than her usual assiduity and earnestness.\n",
      "\n",
      "for two days the patient lay in a state of coma. the doctors came frequently, always to hear the same reply from the pretty nurse, \"no change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "on the third morning miss marston, who was dozing,â€”she had slept only,a few hours during the three days' confinement,â€”was awakened by a cry of \"jump, dell ! jump, my girl!\" mr. birch was regaining consciousness and was calling his mare to jump the park bench into which he had pulled her.\n",
      "\n",
      "the nurse immediately sent for dr. post, who found the patient sitting up in bed, his eyes blazing with a wild expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"did she get hurt?\" he asked curtly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"did who get hurt?\" returned dr. post, soothingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my mare? where am i, anyway?\" he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"in bellevue hospital,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i want to go home; i want to go home,\" he said, determined to have his own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you are not well enough yet.\" the doctor tried to convince him, but without effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i want to go home, home,\" he kept repeating.\n",
      "\n",

      "to all these she had been faithful, dutiful,â€” she had given to them every attention. in stanton birch's behalf she had given even more,â€” her prayers. she was certainly too sensible a girl to imagine herself in love. still, the little fancy came and she beat it back with all her might, but each time it returnedâ€”reinforced.\n",

      "\"oh, pshaw,\" she would say a thousand times a day, \"i have no feeling for this man.\" \"why then,\" would come the inner response, \"do you drop every spoonful of his medicine with so much more care than you ever did for others? why is the touch of your hand so much more gentle and soothing when rubbing his bruises? why do you always end your prayers with 'and most of all, god, grant me my earnest supplication and restore mr. birch to health?' \"\n",

      "before eating his breakfast stanton birch fed his eyes, his heart. his food for thought had been miss marston's mass of black hair of incomparable lustre under her stiff white circular cap; her kind, poetic eyes, deep set beneath heavy lashes; her youthful, girlish figure, every line, every curve of which was perfection.\n",

      "\n",
      "but to let such an opportunity pass would have been madness. he knew that he loved her. each day since he first saw her he had been telling himself so more and more positively. in her he recognized qualities that he had found wanting in the girls of his set; she was natural, she had a knowledge of the things in life that are worth while, and she had a willingness to learn what she did not know; added to this, nature had given her the crowning piece of all things that, according to a man's way of thinking, go to make a woman,â€”beauty.\n",

      "it would have been extremely difficult for anyone to tell which was the younger of the two women. elsie was indeed a pretty girl, with a wealth of exquisite blonde hair, a lock of which always strayed loose and fell over her pretty forehead, keeping her finely shaped hand continually putting it back where it should be, while her pretty blue eyes had the tenderness of youth in them. but in zclda birch's face, though she was forty-two and elsie only twenty-four, there was a youth that had been born to live always, a never-fading beauty.\n",

      "me.\n",

      "\"haven't it in you?\" zelda said, with profound astonishment. \"be reasonable, girl. why try to make yourself a new type of womanhood? i tell you that the intense desire to be a mother is as strong in every married woman to-day as it was in the woman who frantically cried to her husband, 'give me children or i die.' why should it not be in us? do we not start every girl off in babyhood with that end in view? we give to every little girl a doll at christmas; we like to see her hold it; we let her make its little clothes, tell it little stories, sing it little songs, rock it to sleep, prattle the little maternal things to it that she thinks it understands. we make every girl a mother before she knows she's a child.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"one of the things that makes a union bearable, you mean, zelda. you sec, you don't make allowance for the difference in natures. fortune favored you,â€”she gave you a husband who loved books, his home. charlie loves merriment, play, and------\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh bosh!\" interrupted zelda. \"every man naturally loves his own home. he can get as much exercise by playing with his own child upon his knee as he can by saying 'i'm going to take a walk for exercise,' and then goes instead to another house simply because it is kept in better order than the one that his own careless, uncheering wife keeps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but charlie is so young and free, and i wouldn't want to keep him at home. i'm afraid he'd love children like most men love women,â€” they're mad about our smiles, but a tear, a frown, chases them away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"don't talk of the dislikes of the men,\" zelda said a little impatiently. \"let the women find their likes and cater to them, and thus make them at once master and slave.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"myself?\" she answered, with a little care-free smile. \"i am still a shining bubble floating on life's tide, tending nowhere, purposeless, free, laughing, hoping only that it may ever buoy me up and that i may never run into any gurgling whirlpool to swallow me up. you know, zelda, i think that my kind of people are put into the world as a reminder and a stimulus to your kind of people to keep them from forgetting that there is something in the world for them to do.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"how do you do, father birch?\" said elsie,â€” this was what she had always called mr. birch. \"how splendidly you look,\" she continued, \"and as handsome as ever. why tell people you're fifty-six when your looks tell them that you are only forty?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i have engaged a new chef,\" said stanton one morning after breakfast about three weeks after andre's departure. he had just returned from a western trip, having been to texas to look over his cattle ranch and to montana to arrange to sell some of the stock that he owned in the copper mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "on his way home he had stopped in buffalo to see an old clubmate, billy dodd, who was just about to go on a yachting trip on the mediterranean and down the nile. with him, of course, were going many of his servants, but his chef refused to take the journey. therefore stanton engaged the man and took him home with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am so glad, stanton,\" said zelda. \"things have been in a miserably bad condition. will he suit us, do you think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"billy says that he can't be beaten, zelda; suppose you show him what to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "then, with his golf bag, he rode over to the balastol club to put in a morning at the sport that was now rapidly coming to an end because of the cold weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "zelda stood for a moment in the embrasure of a bay window in the morning room watching the leaves that were being blown from the trees and formed into little whirls by the wind. the strength of the breeze through the half-opened window made diminutive hills and valleys in her dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "she pressed the tapering manicured forefinger of her right hand against her lower lip while the other hand pulled nervously at a little grey button on her waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "she was mentally greatly depressed; in her heart there was a heaviness that was uncommon to her. her trepidation, so far as she could see, was without meaning, yet, for that very reason, she was all the more disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why?\" she asked herself. \"why this fear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps fate, fortune, or chance sometimes tells us of the approaching shoals, windstorms, and icebergs while we arc wandering on life's ocean, and we human ships do not more often escape these dangers because we are so utterly heedless of their benevolent admonitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"pshaw; nothing can disturb my happiness,\" she persuaded herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "she never had but one thought that worried her, and while it was, and had been for twenty-five years, a daily visitor, she believed that it was now merely a habit, and she even ventured to say to herself with confidence that the possibility of such a thought's becoming a reality was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes, fate does sometimes warn us of dangers, but, soulless thing! she is too jealous of her own power to let us into her mysteries, thereby revealing to us the means of escape; she likes at times to make high-salaried actors of us all, a tragedian with his stirring bursts of emotion and pathos, a comedian with his lightness and humor, while she,â€”the audience,â€”weeps, laughs, or derides, according to the way our performances impress her.\n",
      "\n",
      "zelda dismissed her forebodings, and went to the kitchen to tell the new man what his duties would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "but as she went her heart became heavier and heavier.\n",
      "\n",
      "when she entered the kitchen the man stood with his back to her, with one hand on the valve of the boiler that was roaring thunderously. so deafening was the noise that leon, the cook, did not even hear her entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"good morning!\" she said to the new man.\n",
      "\n",
      "the chef heard her and seemed a little startled, but he quickly regained his composure and turned, hat in hand, to respond not only politely, but with a courtly bow. zelda had an uncomfortable feeling that she had seen the man somewhere before.\n",
      "\n",
      "why she colored she perhaps never knew, and she would have stoutly denied ever having done so had she later been told of it, yet she was certainly conscious of the hot blood as it rushed to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "why should she be excited? because she had always the constant fear of meeting one man. in this man, though, there could be no danger. she was the employer, he the employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "she eyed him from head to foot. he was dressed in immaculate white, and his clothes fit him faultlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "had he had on a cap with a green crescent-shaped brim, golden cords around the band, and a few silvery stars sprinkled at intervals, one might have said that he was the millionaire owner of a yacht instead of stanton birch's chef.\n",

      "\n",
      "she rushed from the room, and when she reached the dining-room she reeled and would have fallen, but a chair saved her. one glance at that man had been enough to send her into a world of distraction.\n",

      "yet she was not happy. over her hung a cloud of the blackest sort,â€”menacing, threatening, destructive. if she had not seen this man before, she had certainly met one exactly like him. she was tormented by that haunting, ghost-like memory that she could not shake oh.\n",

      "\"bah!\" he scowled wrathfully, \"talk sensibly! my kind of love is not the liberal, self-denying kind; it's the sort that seizes, robs, pillages, wants the whole, everything, for itself. there have been heroes in war, heroes in religion, but the world has never known a hero in love. men who win trophies of women never sacrifice themselves that others may enjoy their prized booty. they want them forever,â€”to feed their aged eyes on when they're old; to quicken the retarding beat of their hearts when they are declining. the man that gave up the woman he loved of his own volition never lived, and never will live. such men are but the phantastic figures created by the brains of novelists after a night of revelry or when their minds are saturated with dream-bringing dope.\"\n",

      "\"but,\" he protested stoutly, \"i tell you a young man about to start out on life's business has no time for love. it too quickly engulfs him in the marital sea? and then what? all the chances of a possible successful life arc hampered. he can never have his freedom any more; his wife cannot hold the high social position that he had dreamed of for her; his child cannot be taken for its morning air in a limousine. money is scarceâ€”the theatre parties, fine gowns, luxurious homes, are now tumbled air castles. he wants her to be like an elderly society leader whose husband has lived long enough to gather millions. but it cannot be. because of his masculine pride he docs not wish to see her below the other women of their early acquaintance. then comes an awful moment. to satisfy his pride he steals a little money and then a little more, and still a little; and then, because he is unsuspected, his recklessness makes him steal all the money he can get his hands on. he is caught, tried, convicted. look, wand---------\" he caught himself again as he uttered her first name. \"look at the number of wrecked lives,â€”his, his wife's, his child's, their aged parents'. or worse yet, suppose the hasty couple before they have lived together a fortnight agree to separate, on the miserable plea of incompatibility of temperament; or suppose each one, having soon after their marriage found a soul mate, decides to go his or her own way. these are all mistakes of youth,â€”blind, impulsive, impatient youth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but the pictures you have drawn are absurd pictures. sensible people marry because they wish to climb together all mountains, to sail together all streams, to bridge together all chasms, to feel together all joys, sorrows, griefs, and disappointments. no, adrian, you cannot mean what you say. you must know better; there is no incompatibility after marriage that did not exist before. love is plain, open, kind; it docs not deceive, it does not lie hidden. each soul knows its mate from its birth, and each can find its own in a crowd of millions. does a mother have to search all through a great gathering of children in order to know the joyful, playful voice of her own? never! the soul of the mother calls to that of the child, and the soul of the child responds to the call,â€”so it is with love and marriage. there is no business of life for a man alone. he must make a business for himself and also for the woman of his choice. this kind of business you are going to plan for me.\n",

      "just how long their limousine had been standing in front of the brocktons' fine home in upper clairmont they did not know, but a servant in livery interrupted their conversation by announcing that mrs. brockton was waiting.\n",

      "mrs. brockton was a dear woman, turning fifty, with chestnut hair streaked with gray, but her face was still almost that of a girl. in temperament she was everything that one could call kind. about her was an ineffable charm that impressed itself unforgettably on everyone that met her. nor was she void of the astuteness and the wit that makes one a power in society. she and wanda's mother had been inseparable companions from their childhood until mrs. croydon's death, which occurred when the girl was yet an infant. mrs. brockton had then taken care of wanda until she went to europe to be educated. and now, although the girl, with a host of servants, lived in the mansion that had been built by her father in boonsville, she still acknowledged mrs. brockton as a foster-mother, which was gratifying to the maternal instinct that was in that good woman's bosom.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "moreover, the pioneer days in the west were still fresh in his mind. he had been a globetrotter, a great reader, a critic, and withal had had time to gather millions of dollars, so that an hour in his presence was sure to be very instructive as well as most agreeable.\n",

      "the most prominent and respected man in new york twenty-five years ago was stanton birch. he was thirty-four, and he possessed a mind, good looks, and riches.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was nothing with which he was not conversant, and concerning many things he had a profound knowledge. art, history, science, invention, fiction, womenâ€”with all these things he was more or less familiar. if he had entered any of the several clubs of which he was a member,â€”the albion, the gilbo, the east end athletic,â€”while a controversy was going on in which neither participant was willing to admit that he was wrong, they would have exclaimed, \"here's birch; let him settle the dispute.\" and so much did they honor him that whatever he said was accepted ex cathedra and the disputations ended. yet he was not a \"man of the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "he knew women and liked them; but he detested the mothers that were ever sending him invitations in order \"to catch\" him because he was unmarried, unrelated, and wealthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "he did not even care for their \"join us tonight at wallack's, box i,\" to see modjeska, ellen terry, mac cullough, or jefferson. the invitations generally came from persons who were narrow, devoid of artistic sense, or unappreciative. he sometimes accepted them, however, because he was sociable, and he could not ignore kindnesses even though they were often shams or subterfuges.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was not a charity organization in new york that had not his name on the list of its contributors, and he always responded to such appeals with liberal donations.\n",
      "\n",
      "but his pastime and his hobby were horses, and the trainer and owner of the most fashionable riding-school in the city said that he was the best horseman he had ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "he was a striking figure one bright morning late in november as he rode down fifth avenue on his superbly caparisoned arabian mare and turned at seventy-second street into central park.\n",
      "\n",
      "the air had in it a crispness that was enlivening, a freshness that was energy-creating. with her head high in the air, her eyes spirited, her ears vacillating, and her step lively, the mare might easily have had her prototype in one of besnard's sleek, lifelike animals jaunting over a red, sunlit moroccan hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "he rode her at a good gallop through the park until he came to sixty-fifth street, near the animal cages, and then suddenly a cry went up.\n",
      "\n",
      "he saw men, women, and children running like savages, making the strangest and most hideous noises.\n",
      "\n",
      "turning, he saw not far distant from him and approaching with accelerating speed a firey-eyed lion that had broken loose from one of the cages.\n",
      "\n",
      "the imperturbability that he always possessed did not forsake him, so he put spurs to the horse. this he thought his only hope, but the mare had already been terrified by the roars of the oncoming beast, and she ran wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "before him seemingly lay two paths to death, if he could not fight out some way of escape. the lion, approaching him from behind, would tear him into bits; the mare, if he could not drop from the saddle unhurt, with her mad, reckless running, would be very likely to throw him against a tree or stone and dash his brains out.\n",
      "\n",
      "he quickly drew the reins to turn the mare behind a hedge, but by his sudden drawing of the reins he turned her into a park bench, which she had to jump. her front feet went over like those of a trained fox-chasing animal, but the hind ones hung on the bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "she went down, and stanton birch was thrown against a huge tree. the wild beast, alarmed, did not stop for the fallen prey, but kept on across to eighth avenue and through sixty-fourth street.\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the park employees ran to the spot where the mare had gone down; there lay the rider limp and unconscious, and the. mare with a broken leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "as the fallen man was lifted up, some one said, \"my god! it's mr. stanton birch.\" every park employee knew him.\n",
      "\n",
      "the man felt stanton birch's pulse. it moved faint and weak. \"send for an ambulance,\" he commanded; \"he's still alive.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "from his pocket he took a flask of whiskey,â€” one could not vouch for its quality,â€”and forced a little of it down mr. birch's throat to warm him until the ambulance should come.\n",
      "\n",
      "in a few minutes the big red hospital wagon from bellevue arrived and took him away.\n",
      "\n",
      "in those exciting moments news of this accident had spread rapidly throughout the city; every paper in town had an extra. publishers and newsboys are always glad when something happens to a personage.\n",
      "\n",
      "over the whole city one could hear their yells: \"extree! extree ! stanton boirch hoirt,\"â€”\"extree! extree ! stanton boirch almost kilt by accident wid 'his hossl git 'em here; two cents a coppee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "as fast as the driver could he rushed the unconscious man to the hospital on twenty-sixth street.\n",
      "\n",
      "an examination showed that the blow had produced a blood clot in the cerebrum.\n",
      "\n",
      "every noted brain specialist and surgeon was sent for at once. an immediate consultation was held; undelayed action was imperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "scientific surgery was then in its incipiency; even the most experienced surgeon would attempt so serious an operation with the gravest fear. it required the most masterful piece of trephining; one little mistake meant death, yet it was the only hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "the operating table was put in order, and the unconscious man was placed upon it. his skull was opened, and the wielder of the sharp instruments moved them with skillful accuracy. around him stood the other surgeons, with faces serious, â€”hopeful,â€”anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "pretty young girls upon whom he might have cast a meaningless smile heard of the accident and hoped sincerely for his recovery. \"who knows?\" they soliloquized. \"i may yet win his heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the old darky head-waiter at the albion club ceased praying for the blessings of the deity on himself and his family and now supplicated him to restore to health \"missah boirch, 'cause he sho is a good man.\" he knew that mr. birch's life meant fifteen or twenty dollars a week more to him. the directors of the charity institutions were in a quandary; whether they would rather have him die and thus take a chance on what he might will them or whether his yearly donations to them meant more was a problem that required close calculation; but they too concluded that it would he better to hope for his recovery than to assume an indifferent air. whether he died or not was immaterial to them so long as they were remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i believe the operation will be successful,\" remarked dr. post, the head surgeon, with confidence, when he had finished. the expression on all their faces became less tense, more hopeful, more confident. \"send for miss marston,\" the doctor continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"she's the pretty, black-haired nurse, is she?\" asked dr. munn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"without an equal to my knowledge,\" answered dr. post, looking hopefully at the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "a young lady of twenty,â€”with widely set, tender, generous, expressive eyes, â€” entered. a sprightly little smile played around her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"miss marston,\" began dr. post, \"this is a very serious case and one that requires the utmost care; that's why i sent for you. . . .you are not to leave his bedside until orders come from me. i'll give you an attendant to wait on you. if you notice any change, if he seems to regain consciousness, notify one of the surgeons at once. you understand?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i think so, sir,\" she answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"then i may trust you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'll do the best i can,\" she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "the doctors turned and left the room, and miss marston went about her work with more than her usual assiduity and earnestness.\n",
      "\n",
      "for two days the patient lay in a state of coma. the doctors came frequently, always to hear the same reply from the pretty nurse, \"no change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "on the third morning miss marston, who was dozing,â€”she had slept only,a few hours during the three days' confinement,â€”was awakened by a cry of \"jump, dell ! jump, my girl!\" mr. birch was regaining consciousness and was calling his mare to jump the park bench into which he had pulled her.\n",
      "\n",
      "the nurse immediately sent for dr. post, who found the patient sitting up in bed, his eyes blazing with a wild expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"did she get hurt?\" he asked curtly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"did who get hurt?\" returned dr. post, soothingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"my mare? where am i, anyway?\" he demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"in bellevue hospital,\" was the reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i want to go home; i want to go home,\" he said, determined to have his own way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"you are not well enough yet.\" the doctor tried to convince him, but without effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i want to go home, home,\" he kept repeating.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how do you feel this morning?\" asked miss marston as she came into his room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"never hungrier in my life,\" he answered smilingly. \"i should feel a thousand times better after some grapefruit, broiled chicken, and a pot of coffee.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"fish is a better food for you,\" said the nurse.\n",
      "\n",
      "a flood of sunbeams searched into every nook and corner of the sumptuous room that overlooked fifth avenue and central park; and a flood of the sunshine of happy hearts made glad by the approach of christmas,â€”the season when everyone, everything, is glad,â€”crowded stanton birch's heart as he looked out and saw the peddlers with their holly, cedar, and mistletoe, as he heard the \"ding-a-ling-a-ling\" of the salvation army bell, the happy children asking one another, \"what is santa claus going to bring you?\" and all the other messengers announcing the joyous holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "just why miss marston should have been more anxious about this patient than about any of the others that she had nursed she could'not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "fresh in her memory were many distorted faces and numbers of pain-racked bodies, some of which she had nursed back to health, and others that the unconqucred conqueror had taken for his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "to all these she had been faithful, dutiful,â€” she had given to them every attention. in stanton birch's behalf she had given even more,â€” her prayers. she was certainly too sensible a girl to imagine herself in love. still, the little fancy came and she beat it back with all her might, but each time it returnedâ€”reinforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, pshaw,\" she would say a thousand times a day, \"i have no feeling for this man.\" \"why then,\" would come the inner response, \"do you drop every spoonful of his medicine with so much more care than you ever did for others? why is the touch of your hand so much more gentle and soothing when rubbing his bruises? why do you always end your prayers with 'and most of all, god, grant me my earnest supplication and restore mr. birch to health?' \"\n",
      "\n",
      "she turned to give him an \"after-each-meal\" dose from the bottle labeled \"shake well before using,\" and found his eyes fastened on her. for a moment she was confused, but she regained her composure almost instantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "before eating his breakfast stanton birch fed his eyes, his heart. his food for thought had been miss marston's mass of black hair of incomparable lustre under her stiff white circular cap; her kind, poetic eyes, deep set beneath heavy lashes; her youthful, girlish figure, every line, every curve of which was perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"what young flower could have died prematurely and left its roseate tint upon her checks and its fragrance on her breath?\" he thought as she was about to give him the spoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"come on, my lady aesculapius,\" he remarked, with a smile, as he took the medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"aesculapius had divine power,\" she retorted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"so would you have, were this mt. olympus,\" he went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but he could cure by mixing medicines,\" she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"yours is a subtler and more advanced science of therapeutics,\" he continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "she would not go on further. instinctively she knew that he had watched all her little over-carefulnesses and had interpreted their meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"mr. birch,\" she said, \"i'm going to leave you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "her words startled him; how had he offended her?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"come, miss marston,\" he said, with a look of contriteness. \"i've been brusque to you; you'll pardon my rudeness, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, no; not that. no one could ha\\e been kinder to me; only iâ€”\" she stammered for a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"salary then?\" he broke in. \"well, name your price and i shall pay twice the sum demanded; only you must stay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"please, mr. birch, it isn't that.\" she began twitching her lingers. \"you see you are quite on the road to recovery now, and i must go back to the hospital where others need me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but who told you i was well?\" he protested. \"i understood that you were to nurse me until i had fully recovered.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "she did not answer; she could not. she felt the warm tears gathering in her eyes and she thought he saw them.\n",
      "\n",
      "nor did he press further. he felt strong emotions tugging at his heart, and he thought she read them through his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "stanton birch had had everything he had wanted in life, and a great deal of it he had got by asking for it. yet, here was this beautiful girl, lovely in every way, and his lips refused him that which his heart wished to speak. he was not afraid; he was ashamed. his covert manner in his lovemaking to her had been unworthy of the way in which gentlemen make queens of the women whom they love.\n",
      "\n",
      "if he had dazzled her beautiful white neck with jewels, if he had brought her orchids and roses, if he had sent her bonbons, if he had taken her to operas and suppers, he would have felt differently about it, but not one thing had he done for her pleasure, there had been no love-making save the fervent glances and friendly words that had passed between them in his room.\n",
      "\n",
      "but to let such an opportunity pass would have been madness. he knew that he loved her. each day since he first saw her he had been telling himself so more and more positively. in her he recognized qualities that he had found wanting in the girls of his set; she was natural, she had a knowledge of the things in life that are worth while, and she had a willingness to learn what she did not know; added to this, nature had given her the crowning piece of all things that, according to a man's way of thinking, go to make a woman,â€”beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "he got up, resolute, and went over to the girl, caught her in his arms, pressed her to him, and showered passionate kisses upon her lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"zelda, you are not going to leave this house. you say i am well, but i am not. my heart is sick with love, and if you refuse my wish, it is sick with an ill that can never be cured until our souls meet in heaven. i knew from the moment i saw you that i loved you; i had never loved before, neither had you, but we each knew from the first that we loved each other. there's but one way for our happiness; will you choose it with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "the girl was frightened and she tried to wrench herself from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why do you say such things to me?\" she demanded, still trying to free herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "but his grip became firmer. \"i say them because they arc the things my heart wants to say and because they are the things your heart wants to hear. . . . you called me well; from the accident i may be, but do you suppose it was because of those badly put-up drugs that i was healed? no; i took them because they came from your sweet hands. the kind look in your eyes, the sweet words from your lips, the soothing touch from your hand,â€”they were restorative.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but please, please, let me go, mr. birch,\" she begged. \"you do not know my past. between us stands birth, wealth, position, and i could never make you happy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"if your past were as black as midnight,\" he said passionately, \"your face would still have its heavenly light for me. between us stands nothing but the unbreakable chain of love to which every human being must link himself if he would find happiness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"won't you release me, please ?\" she whispered, \"i must go back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "she felt herself beginning to weaken. if he had taken his arms from her waist then, hers would have wandered up and clung to his neck. she felt his pulsating heart; she breathed his warm breath; was she conscious of what she was doing when she asked to be released?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why not stay in my country?\" he- went on jestingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"where is your country?\" her words were scarcely audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" 'tis this old fifth avenue home, the walls of which are embellished with paintings and tapestries made by men when men had patience, genius; the floors of which are covered with bear skins from the frigid arctic and tiger skins from torrid india,â€”skins that foolish adventurers have given their lives for. in the closets are the costliest porcelains and there are a few jewelry chests that contain many valuables. over all this rules king love. let us be his never-sleeping, never-wearying bodyguards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"how do you know i can stand the immigration test?\" she asked, almost with a smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am the sole inspector and will pass you with honors, if you but enter my port.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"do you think you'll always want me for an inhabitant?\" she asked, troubled, uneasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "''i swear to treasure you always as my most prized citizen; will you enter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "she did not speak but stood on her toes and kissed his waiting lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "he rang for the butler to come for the breakfast tray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"john,\" he said as the butler came in, ''tell andre to cook with more care.\" then turning to miss marston he continued, \"he's an old-time cook, but he makes far better bouillon and roasts than that irish chefess you had at the hospital.\" john took the tray and went out.\n",
      "\n",
      "a few days afterward stanton birch and his nurse were married.\n",
      "\n",
      "the years passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "they were happy. and why not, when every gentle breeze that, bearing the winged messenger of love and striking the cords of their hearts, made the strings reverberate, lyre-like, with perfect harmony; when glittering-headed gold had opened her vault and poured her treasure into their hands until they were running over, and when in themselves was that bigness of soul and soundness of mind that taught them the best use of their blessings?\n",
      "\n",
      "moreover, to crown their happiness the future of their twenty-two-year-old son blazed with brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "they held up to the world a mirror of wonderful transparency; and the world, smiling back at them, said: \"i am not such a bad thing, after all, if only cynics, critics, and pessimists would boost sometimes rather than 'knock' always.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "if on this mirror they saw a blur,â€”a hungering soul, a painful body, a diseased brain,â€”the philanthropic spirit within them said at once: \"i am here, your ever ready and willing servant. send me as a comforter to do the best i can for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "naturally, they were happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "their costly home stood on the top of one of the mountains in clairmont, and its bronzed roof caught the sun's first rays as they awoke in the morning and the last danced on it as they retired at night.\n",

      "\n",
      "they were in the library, she sitting upright in an old-fashioned chair while he was half reclining in a morris chair on the opposite side of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "the light from the bluish-green shade of the electric light struck the side of his face, accentuating the noble outlines of his intellectual temples. he had been reading an account of the above-named convention in the tell tale, which journal discussed american problems and conditions more liberally, with greater judgment, and with less injustice than any other american periodical, and to a man of his unbiased mind the bitter philippics were naturally disgusting. he seemed annoyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh botheration !\"â€”this was his favorite and strongest expressionâ€”\"why can't they let these people alone?\" he said, with force and a frown. \"between them and us lie centuries of african wildness and two hundred and fifty years of american bondage !\"\n",

      "\"my dear wife,\" he replied a little impatiently, beating the palm of his hand against the table, \"be sensible; that's a perversion of ignorance that has caused the blood of a million souls. i tell you we are all the same in essence. whether you believe that man was evolved from the plastic little amoeba, whether you believe that life was hurled on earth by some flying meteorite from another world, or whether you wish to be old-fashioned and accept the biblical explanation of thingsâ€”\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i accept the biblical explanation.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"leave it to the south?\" he demanded, turning himself around. \"it's not a negro problem, it is not a southern problem, it is a human, live american problem. should the settlement of the 'immigration question' be left to new york because most of the immigrants come to new york's harbor and because many of them settle in that city? no; just so, then, with these people.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"hello, ad,\" said the father.\n",

      "\n",
      "mrs. birch was particularly delighted to hear about the van demans. elsie had been one of her favorites and, though she had never breathed it to anyone, she had at one time fancied that she would like her as a daughter-in-law, but charlie van deman had captivated elsie. they had forsaken america immediately after their marriage for a european stay of five years and had just the day before this dinner arrived in new york from paris.\n",

      "in her mind she saw beautiful girls to whom the best of the earth had been given at their nuptials,â€”mansions, tiaras, diamonds, millions, everything,â€”and on her fingers she enumerated sixteen to whom hymen had come during the preceding five years.\n",

      "\"one of the things that makes a union bearable, you mean, zelda. you sec, you don't make allowance for the difference in natures. fortune favored you,â€”she gave you a husband who loved books, his home. charlie loves merriment, play, and------\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh bosh!\" interrupted zelda. \"every man naturally loves his own home. he can get as much exercise by playing with his own child upon his knee as he can by saying 'i'm going to take a walk for exercise,' and then goes instead to another house simply because it is kept in better order than the one that his own careless, uncheering wife keeps.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"myself?\" she answered, with a little care-free smile. \"i am still a shining bubble floating on life's tide, tending nowhere, purposeless, free, laughing, hoping only that it may ever buoy me up and that i may never run into any gurgling whirlpool to swallow me up. you know, zelda, i think that my kind of people are put into the world as a reminder and a stimulus to your kind of people to keep them from forgetting that there is something in the world for them to do.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"how do you do, father birch?\" said elsie,â€” this was what she had always called mr. birch. \"how splendidly you look,\" she continued, \"and as handsome as ever. why tell people you're fifty-six when your looks tell them that you are only forty?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"i have engaged a new chef,\" said stanton one morning after breakfast about three weeks after andre's departure. he had just returned from a western trip, having been to texas to look over his cattle ranch and to montana to arrange to sell some of the stock that he owned in the copper mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "on his way home he had stopped in buffalo to see an old clubmate, billy dodd, who was just about to go on a yachting trip on the mediterranean and down the nile. with him, of course, were going many of his servants, but his chef refused to take the journey. therefore stanton engaged the man and took him home with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"i am so glad, stanton,\" said zelda. \"things have been in a miserably bad condition. will he suit us, do you think?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"billy says that he can't be beaten, zelda; suppose you show him what to do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "then, with his golf bag, he rode over to the balastol club to put in a morning at the sport that was now rapidly coming to an end because of the cold weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "zelda stood for a moment in the embrasure of a bay window in the morning room watching the leaves that were being blown from the trees and formed into little whirls by the wind. the strength of the breeze through the half-opened window made diminutive hills and valleys in her dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "she pressed the tapering manicured forefinger of her right hand against her lower lip while the other hand pulled nervously at a little grey button on her waist.\n",
      "\n",
      "she was mentally greatly depressed; in her heart there was a heaviness that was uncommon to her. her trepidation, so far as she could see, was without meaning, yet, for that very reason, she was all the more disturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"why?\" she asked herself. \"why this fear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps fate, fortune, or chance sometimes tells us of the approaching shoals, windstorms, and icebergs while we arc wandering on life's ocean, and we human ships do not more often escape these dangers because we are so utterly heedless of their benevolent admonitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"pshaw; nothing can disturb my happiness,\" she persuaded herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "she never had but one thought that worried her, and while it was, and had been for twenty-five years, a daily visitor, she believed that it was now merely a habit, and she even ventured to say to herself with confidence that the possibility of such a thought's becoming a reality was impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes, fate does sometimes warn us of dangers, but, soulless thing! she is too jealous of her own power to let us into her mysteries, thereby revealing to us the means of escape; she likes at times to make high-salaried actors of us all, a tragedian with his stirring bursts of emotion and pathos, a comedian with his lightness and humor, while she,â€”the audience,â€”weeps, laughs, or derides, according to the way our performances impress her.\n",
      "\n",
      "zelda dismissed her forebodings, and went to the kitchen to tell the new man what his duties would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "but as she went her heart became heavier and heavier.\n",
      "\n",
      "when she entered the kitchen the man stood with his back to her, with one hand on the valve of the boiler that was roaring thunderously. so deafening was the noise that leon, the cook, did not even hear her entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"good morning!\" she said to the new man.\n",
      "\n",
      "the chef heard her and seemed a little startled, but he quickly regained his composure and turned, hat in hand, to respond not only politely, but with a courtly bow. zelda had an uncomfortable feeling that she had seen the man somewhere before.\n",
      "\n",
      "why she colored she perhaps never knew, and she would have stoutly denied ever having done so had she later been told of it, yet she was certainly conscious of the hot blood as it rushed to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "why should she be excited? because she had always the constant fear of meeting one man. in this man, though, there could be no danger. she was the employer, he the employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "she eyed him from head to foot. he was dressed in immaculate white, and his clothes fit him faultlessly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"yes,\" her husband answered, consolingly, his soft hand still rubbing her forehead. \"the blood shook you all up; shall i send for a doctor?\" \"oh, no, stanton!\" she protested. \"i shall be all right in a moment, i'm sure.\"\n",

      "\"but,\" he protested stoutly, \"i tell you a young man about to start out on life's business has no time for love. it too quickly engulfs him in the marital sea? and then what? all the chances of a possible successful life arc hampered. he can never have his freedom any more; his wife cannot hold the high social position that he had dreamed of for her; his child cannot be taken for its morning air in a limousine. money is scarceâ€”the theatre parties, fine gowns, luxurious homes, are now tumbled air castles. he wants her to be like an elderly society leader whose husband has lived long enough to gather millions. but it cannot be. because of his masculine pride he docs not wish to see her below the other women of their early acquaintance. then comes an awful moment. to satisfy his pride he steals a little money and then a little more, and still a little; and then, because he is unsuspected, his recklessness makes him steal all the money he can get his hands on. he is caught, tried, convicted. look, wand---------\" he caught himself again as he uttered her first name. \"look at the number of wrecked lives,â€”his, his wife's, his child's, their aged parents'. or worse yet, suppose the hasty couple before they have lived together a fortnight agree to separate, on the miserable plea of incompatibility of temperament; or suppose each one, having soon after their marriage found a soul mate, decides to go his or her own way. these are all mistakes of youth,â€”blind, impulsive, impatient youth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but the pictures you have drawn are absurd pictures. sensible people marry because they wish to climb together all mountains, to sail together all streams, to bridge together all chasms, to feel together all joys, sorrows, griefs, and disappointments. no, adrian, you cannot mean what you say. you must know better; there is no incompatibility after marriage that did not exist before. love is plain, open, kind; it docs not deceive, it does not lie hidden. each soul knows its mate from its birth, and each can find its own in a crowd of millions. does a mother have to search all through a great gathering of children in order to know the joyful, playful voice of her own? never! the soul of the mother calls to that of the child, and the soul of the child responds to the call,â€”so it is with love and marriage. there is no business of life for a man alone. he must make a business for himself and also for the woman of his choice. this kind of business you are going to plan for me.\n",
